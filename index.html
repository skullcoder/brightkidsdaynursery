      <h1>Administering Medicines Policy</h1>

      <div class="header-info">
        Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd<br>
        Adopted: 23/08/2025 | To be reviewed: 22/08/2026
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Health</h2>
        <p>Providers must promote the good health of children attending the setting and take necessary steps to prevent
          the spread of infection.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Policy statement</h2>
      <p>While it is not our policy to care for sick children, who should be at home until they are well enough to
        return to the setting, we will agree to administer medication as part of maintaining their health and well-being
        or when they are recovering from an illness. We ensure that where medicines are necessary to maintain health of
        the child, they are given correctly and in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
      <p>In many cases, it is possible for children’s GPs to prescribe medicine that can be taken at home in the morning
        and evening. As far as possible, administering medicines will only be done where it would be detrimental to the
        child’s health if not given in the setting. If a child has not had a medication before, especially a baby/child
        under two, it is advised that the parent keeps the child at home for the first 48 hours to ensure there are no
        adverse effects, as well as to give time for the medication to take effect.</p>
      <p>Our staff are responsible for the correct administration of medication to children for whom they are the key
        person responsible for the correct administration of medication to children who attend my setting. This includes
        ensuring that parent consent forms have been completed, that medicines are stored correctly and that records are
        kept according to procedures. In the absence of the key person, the manager is responsible for the overseeing of
        administering medication. I notify our insurance provider of all required conditions, as laid out in our
        insurance policy.</p>

      <h2>Procedures</h2>
      <div class="procedures-section">
        <ul class="procedures-list">
          <li>Children taking prescribed medication must be well enough to attend the setting.</li>
          <li>We only usually administer medication when it has been prescribed for a child by a doctor (or other
            medically qualified person). It must be in-date and prescribed for the current condition.</li>
          <li>Non-prescription medication, such as pain or fever relief (e.g. Calpol) and teething gel, anti-histamine
            or inhalers may be administered, but only with prior written consent of the parent and only when there is a
            health reason to do so, such as a high temperature. Children under the age of 16 years are never given
            medicines containing aspirin unless prescribed specifically for that child by a doctor. The administering of
            un-prescribed medication is recorded in the same way as any other medication. NB We may administer
            children’s paracetamol (un-prescribed) for children under the age of one year with the verbal consent of the
            parents in the case of a high temperature. This is to prevent febrile convulsion and where a parent or named
            person is on their way to collect the child.</li>
          <li>Children's prescribed medicines are stored in their original containers, are clearly labelled and are
            inaccessible to the children. On receiving the medication, the member of staff checks that it is in date and
            prescribed specifically for the current condition.</li>
          <li>Parents must give prior written permission for the administration of medication. The staff member
            receiving the medication will ask the parent to sign a consent form stating the following information. No
            medication may be given without these details being provided:
            <ul>
              <li>the full name of child and date of birth</li>
              <li>the name of medication and strength</li>
              <li>who prescribed it</li>
              <li>the dosage and times to be given in the setting</li>
              <li>the method of administration</li>
              <li>how the medication should be stored and its expiry date</li>
              <li>any possible side effects that may be expected</li>
              <li>the signature of the parent, their printed name and the date</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The administration of medicine is recorded accurately in our medication record book each time it is given
            and is signed by the person administering the medication and a witness. Parents are shown the record at the
            end of the day and asked to sign the record book to acknowledge the administration of the medicine. The
            medication record book records the:
            <ul>
              <li>name of the child</li>
              <li>name and strength of the medication</li>
              <li>name of the doctor that prescribed it</li>
              <li>date and time of the dose</li>
              <li>dose given and method</li>
              <li>signature of the person administering the medication and a witness who verifies that the medication
                has been given correctly</li>
              <li>parent’s signature (at the end of the day)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We use the Pre-school Learning Alliance Medication Administration Record book for recording the
            administration of medicine and comply with the detailed procedures set out in that publication.</li>
          <li>If the administration of prescribed medication requires medical knowledge, we obtain individual training
            for the relevant member of staff by a health professional.</li>
          <li>If rectal diazepam is given, another member of staff must be present and co-signs the record book.</li>
          <li>No child may self-administer. Where children are capable of understanding when they need medication, for
            example with asthma, they should be encouraged to tell their key person what they need. However, this does
            not replace staff vigilance in knowing and responding when a child requires medication.</li>
          <li>We monitor the medication record book is monitored to look at the frequency of medication given in the
            setting. For example, a high incidence of antibiotics being prescribed for a number of children at similar
            times may indicate a need for better infection control.</li>
          <li>Any medication that has not been given to children before, must be administered by parents at home and
            monitored at home for 48 hours before child is allowed back in the setting.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Storage of medicines</h2>
      <div class="procedures-section">
        <ul class="procedures-list">
          <li>All medication is stored safely in a locked cupboard or refrigerated as required. Where the cupboard or
            refrigerator is not used solely for storing medicines, they are kept in a marked plastic box.</li>
          <li>The child’s key person is responsible for ensuring medicine is handed back at the end of the day to the
            parent.</li>
          <li>All medicine must be administered by a qualified level 3 member of staff with paediatric first aid
            training.</li>
          <li>For some conditions, medication may be kept in the setting to be administered on a regular or
            as-and-when-required basis. Key persons check that any medication held in the setting, is in date and return
            any out-of-date medication back to the parent.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <ul class="procedures-list">
          <li>We carry out a risk assessment for each child with a long term medical condition that requires on-going
            medication. This is the responsibility of our manager alongside the key person. Other medical or social care
            personnel may need to be involved in the risk assessment.</li>
          <li>Parents will also contribute to a risk assessment. They should be shown around the setting, understand the
            routines and activities and point out anything which they think may be a risk factor for their child.</li>
          <li>For some medical conditions, key staff will need to have training in a basic understanding of the
            condition, as well as how the medication is to be administered correctly. The training needs for staff form
            part of the risk assessment.</li>
          <li>The risk assessment includes vigorous activities and any other activity that may give cause for concern
            regarding an individual child’s health needs.</li>
          <li>The risk assessment includes arrangements for taking medicines on outings and advice is sought from the
            child’s GP if necessary where there are concerns.</li>
          <li>An individual health plan for the child is drawn up with the parent; outlining the key person’s role and
            what information must be shared with other adults who care for the child.</li>
          <li>The individual health plan should include the measures to be taken in an emergency.</li>
          <li>We review the individual health plan every six months, or more frequently if necessary. This includes
            reviewing the medication, e.g. changes to the medication or the dosage, any side effects noted etc.</li>
          <li>Parents receive a copy of the individual health plan and each contributor, including the parent, signs it.
          </li>

      <p class="section-title">Managing medicines on trips and outings</p>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <ul class="procedures-list">
          <li>If children are going on outings, the key person for the child will accompany the children with a risk
            assessment, or another member of staff/childminder who is fully informed about the child’s needs and/or
            medication.</li>
          <li>Medication for a child is taken in a sealed plastic box clearly labelled with the child’s name, the
            original pharmacist’s label and the name of the medication. Inside the box is a copy of the consent form and
            a card to record when it has been given, including all the details that need to be recorded in the
            medication record as stated above. For medication dispensed by a hospital pharmacy, where the child’s
            details are not on the dispensing label, we will record the circumstances of the event and hospital
            instructions as relayed by the parents.</li>
          <li>On returning to the setting the card is stapled to the medicine record book and the parent signs it.</li>
          <li>If a child on medication has to be taken to hospital, the child’s medication is taken in a sealed plastic
            box clearly labelled with the child’s name and the name of the medication. Inside the box is a copy of the
            consent form signed by the parent.</li>
          <li>This procedure should be read alongside the outings procedure.</li>

        <p>In our setting, staff and managers can be said to have a 'confidential relationship' with families. It is our
          intention
          to respect the privacy of children and their parents and carers, while ensuring that they access high quality
          early
          years care and education in our setting. We aim to ensure that all parents and carers can share their
          information
          in the confidence that it will only be used to enhance the welfare of their children. We have record keeping
          systems in place that meet legal requirements; the means that we use to store and share that information takes

          and

        <h2>Confidentiality procedures</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Most things that happen between the family, the child and the setting are confidential to our setting. In
            exceptional circumstances information is shared, for example with other professionals or possibly social
            care
            or the police.</li>
          <li>Information shared with other agencies is done in line with our Information Sharing Policy.</li>
          <li>We always check whether parents regard the information they share with us to be confidential or not.</li>
          <li>Some parents may share information about themselves with other parents as well as with our staff; we
            cannot
            be held responsible if information is shared by those parents whom the person has 'confided' in.</li>
          <li>
            Information shared between parents in a discussion or training group is usually bound by a shared agreement
            that the information is confidential to the group and not discussed outside of it. We are not responsible
            should
            that confidentiality be breached by participants.
          </li>
          <li>We inform parents when we need to record confidential information beyond the general personal information
            we keep <span class="highlight">(see our Children's Records Policy and Privacy Notice)</span> - for example
            with regard to any injuries,
            concerns or changes in relation to the child or the family, any discussions with parents on sensitive
            matters,
            any records we are obliged to keep regarding action taken in respect of child protection and any contact and
            correspondence with external agencies in relation to their child.</li>
          <li>We keep all records securely (see our Children's Records Policy and Privacy Notice).</li>
          <li>Information is kept in a manual file, or electronically. Our staff may also use a computer to type
            reports,
            or
            letters. Where this is the case, the typed document is deleted from the PC and only the hard copy kept.</li>
          <li>Where it is helpful to keep an electronic copy nobody has access to the main PC</li>
          <li>Our staff discuss children's general progress and well being together in meetings, but more sensitive
            information is restricted to our manager and the child's key person, and is shared with other staff on a
            need
            to
            know basis</li>
          <li>We do not discuss children with [staff who are not involved in the child's care, nor with] other parents
            or
            anyone else outside of the setting</li>
          <li>Our discussions with other professionals take place within a professional framework and not on an informal
            or
            ad-hoc basis.</li>
          <li>Where third parties share information about an individual us; our practitioners and managers check if it
            is
            confidential, both in terms of the party sharing the information and of the person whom the information
            concerns.</li>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Client access to records procedures</h2>
        <p>Parents may request access to any confidential records we hold on their child and family following the
          procedure
          below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The parent is the 'subject' of the file in the case where a child is too young to give 'informed consent'
            and has
            a right to see information that our setting has compiled on them.</li>
          <li>Any request to see the child's personal file by a parent or person with parental responsibility must be
            made
            in
            writing to the setting leader or manager.</li>
          <li>We acknowledge the request in writing, informing the parent that an arrangement will be made for him/her
            to
            see the file contents, subject to third party consent.</li>
          <li class="highlight">Our written acknowledgement allows one month for the file to be made ready and
            available.
            We will be able to
            extend this by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous. If this is the case, We will
            inform you within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary</li>
          <li class="highlight">A fee may be charged for repeated requests, or where a request requires excessive
            administration to fulfil.</li>
          <li>Our manager informs their line manager and legal advice may be sought before sharing a file may seek legal
            advice before sharing a file.</li>
          <li>Our manager goes through the file with their line manager and ensures go through the file and ensure that
            all
            documents have been filed correctly, that entries are in date order and that there are no missing pages.
            They
            note any information, entry or correspondence or other document which mentions a third party.</li>
          <li>We write to each of those individuals explaining that the subject has requested sight of the file, which
            contains
            a reference to them, stating what this is</li>
          <li>They are asked to reply in writing to our manager giving or refusing consent for disclosure of that
            material.</li>
          <li>We keep copies of these letters and their replies on the child's file.</li>
          <li>Third parties' include each family member noted on the file; so where there are separate entries
            pertaining
            to
            each parent, step parent, grandparent etc. we write to each of them to request third party consent.</li>
          <li>Third parties also include workers from any other agency, including children's social care and the health
            authority for example. Agencies will normally refuse consent to share information, preferring instead for
            the
            parent to be redirected to those agencies for a request to see their file held by that agency.</li>
          <li>Members of our staff should also be written to, but we reserve the right under the legislation to override
            a
            refusal for consent or to just delete the name of the staff member and not the information. We may grant
            refusal if the member of staff has provided information that could be considered 'sensitive' and the staff
            member may be in danger if that information is disclosed; or if that information is the basis of a police
            investigation. However, if the information is not sensitive, then it is not in our interest to withhold that
            information from a parent. In each case this should be discussed with members of staff and decisions
            recorded.</li>
          <li>When we have received all the consents/refusals our manager takes a photocopy of the complete file. On the
            copy of the file, our manager removes any information that a third party has refused consent for us to
            disclose
            and blank out any references to the third party, and any information they have added to the file, using a
            thick
            marker pen.</li>
          <li>The copy file is then checked by the line manager and legal advisors to verify that the file has been
            prepared
            appropriately.</li>
          <li>What remains is the information recorded by the setting, detailing the work initiated and followed by them
            in
            relation to confidential matters. This is called the 'clean copy'.</li>
          <li>We photocopy the 'clean copy' again and collate it for the parent to see</li>
          <li>Our manager informs the parent that the file is now ready and invite[s] him/her to make an appointment to
            view it.</li>
          <li>Our manager and their line manager meet with the parent to go through the file, explaining the process as
            well
            as what the content of the file records about the child and the work that has been done. Only the person(s)
            with parental responsibility can attend that meeting, or the parent's legal representative or interpreter.
          </li>
          <li>The parent may take a copy of the prepared file away; but, to ensure it is properly explained to and
            understood by the parent, we never hand it over without discussion.</li>
          <li>It is an offence to remove material that is controversial or to rewrite records to make them more
            acceptable.
            Our recording procedures and guidelines ensure that the material reflects an accurate and non-judgemental
            account of the work we have done with the family</li>
          <li>If a parent feels aggrieved about any entry in the file, or the resulting outcome, then we refer the
            parent
            to our
            complaints procedure.</li>
          <li>
            The law requires that the information we hold must be <span class="highlight">held for a legitimate reason
              and must be</span> accurate (see
            our Privacy Notice). If a parent says that the information we hold is inaccurate, then the parent has a
            right
            to
            request for it to be changed. However, this only pertains to factual inaccuracies. Where the disputed entry
            is
            a
            matter of opinion, professional judgement, or represents a different view of the matter than that held by
            the
            parent, we retain the right not to change that entry, but we can record the parent's view of the matter. In
            most
            cases, we would have given a parent the opportunity at the time to state their side of the matter, and it
            would
            have been recorded there and then.
          </li>
          <li>If there are any controversial aspects of the content of a child's file, we must seek legal advice. This
            might be
            where there is a court case between parents, where social care or the police may be considering legal
            action,
            or where a case has already completed and an appeal process is underway.</li>
          <li>We never 'under-record' for fear of the parent seeing, nor do we make 'personal notes' elsewhere.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Policy statement</h2>
      <p>We regard snack and meal times as an important part of our day. Eating represents a social time for children
        and adults, and helps children to learn about healthy eating. At snack and meal times, we aim to provide
        nutritious food, which meets the children's individual dietary needs.</p>
      <h2>Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        We follow these procedures to promote healthy eating in [our/my] setting.
      </p>
      <p>Before a child starts to attend the setting, we ask their parents about their dietary needs and preferences,
        including any allergies. (See the Managing Children who are Sick, Infectious or with Allergies Policy.)</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We record information about each child's dietary needs in the Registration Form and parents sign the form
          to signify that it is correct.</li>
        <li>We regularly consult with parents to ensure that our records of their children's dietary needs – including
          any allergies - are up-to-date. Parents sign the updated record to signify that it is correct.</li>
        <li>We display current information about individual children's dietary needs so that all our staff and
          volunteers
          are fully informed about them.</li>
        <li>We implement systems to ensure that children receive only food and drink that is consistent with their
          dietary needs and preferences, as well as their parents' wishes.</li>
        <li>We plan menus in line with EYFS Nutritious Mela guidelines.(2025)</li>
        <li>We display the menus of meals/snacks for parents to view including allergens</li>
        <li>We provide nutritious food for all meals and snacks, avoiding large quantities of saturated fat, sugar and
          salt and artificial additives, preservatives and colourings.</li>
        <li>We include a variety of foods from the four main food groups:<br>
          - meat, fish and protein alternatives<br>
          - dairy foods <br>
          - grains, cereals and starch vegetables <br>
          - fruit and vegetables</li>
        <li>We include foods from the diet of each of the children's cultural backgrounds, providing children with
          familiar foods and introducing them to new ones.</li>
        <li>We take care not to provide food containing nuts or nut products and we are especially vigilant where we
          have a child who has a known allergy to nuts.</li>
        <li>Through discussion with parents and research reading, we obtain information about the dietary rules of the
          religious groups to which children and their parents belong, and of vegetarians and vegans, as well as
          about food allergies. We take account of this information in the provision of food and drinks.</li>
        <li>We provide a vegetarian alternative on days when meat or fish are offered and make every effort to ensure
          Halal meat is available for children who require it.</li>
        <li>We show sensitivity in providing for children's diets and allergies. We do not use a child's diet or allergy
          as
          a label for the child, or make a child feel singled out because of her/his diet or allergy.</li>
        <li>We organise meal and snack times so that they are social occasions in which children and adults
          participate</li>
        <li>We use meal and snack times to help children to develop independence through making choices, serving
          food and drink and feeding themselves.</li>
        <li>We provide children with utensils that are appropriate for their ages and stages of development and that
          take account of the eating practices in their cultures.</li>
        <li>We have fresh drinking water constantly available for the children. We inform the children about how to
          obtain the water and that they can ask for water at any time during the day.</li>
        <li>In accordance with parents' wishes, we offer children arriving early in the morning, and/or staying late, an
          appropriate meal or snack</li>
        <li>We inform parents who provide food for their children about the storage facilities available in our setting.
        </li>
        <li>We give parents who provide food for their children information about suitable containers for food</li>
        <li>In order to protect children with food allergies, we discourage children from sharing and swapping their
          food with one another.</li>
        <li>For young children who drink milk, we provide whole pasteurised milk. Although we slowly introduce
          semiskimmed milk from the age of two years; firstly into meals and dishes, such as on cereal or in white
          sauces, before offering it as a drink, so that the transition is gradual.</li>
        <li>For each child under two, we provide parents with daily written information about feeding routines, intake
          and preferences.</li>
        <li>We serve small portions of food to the children and give them second helping if they ask. We do not
          overfeed the children.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Packed lunches</em></p>
      <p>Where Parents choose to bring in packed lunch</p>
      <p>ensure perishable contents of packed lunches are refrigerated or contain an ice pack to keep food cool;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>inform parents of our policy on healthy eating;</li>
        <li>inform parents of whether we have facilities to microwave cooked food brought from home;</li>
        <li>encourage parents to provide sandwiches with a healthy filling, fruit, and milk-based deserts, such as
          yoghurt or crème fraiche. We discourage sweet drinks, sweets, crisps and will provide children with water;
        </li>
        <li>discourage packed lunch contents that consist largely of crisps, processed foods, sweet drinks and sweet
          products such as cakes or biscuits. We reserve the right to return this food to the parent as a last resort;
        </li>
        <li>We will not serve rice if bough from home this is due to high risk bacteria grown</li>

        <li>ensure that adults sit with children to eat their lunch so that the mealtime is a social occasion.</li>

      <h2>Policy statement</h2>
      <p>Children’s safety is our highest priority, both on and off the premises. Every attempt is made, through the
        implementation of our outings procedure and our exit/entrance procedure, to ensure the security of children is
        maintained at all times. In the unlikely event of a child going missing, our missing child procedure is
        followed.</p>
      <h2>Procedures</h2>
      <p><em>Child going missing on the premises</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As soon as it is noticed that a child is missing, the child’s key person/the relevant member of staff alerts
          our
          setting manager</li>
        <li>The register is checked to make sure no other child has also gone astray</li>
        <li>Our manager will carry out a thorough search of the building and garden.</li>
        <li>Doors and gates are checked to see if there has been a breach of security whereby a child could wander
          out.</li>
        <li>If the child is not found, our manager calls the police immediately and reports the child as missing. If it
          is
          suspected that the child may have been abducted, the police are informed of this.</li>
        <li>The parent(s) are then called and informed.</li>
        <li>A recent photo and a note of what the child is wearing is given to the police.</li>
        <li>Our manager talks to our staff to find out when and where the child was last seen and records this.</li>
        <li>Our manager contacts our director and reports the incident. Our director comes to the provision immediately
          to
          carry out an investigation, with our management team where appropriate.</li>

      </ul>
      <p><em>Child going missing on an outing</em></p>
      <p>This describes what to do when our staff have taken a small group on an outing, leaving our manager and/or
        other staff back in our setting premises. If our manager has accompanied children on the outing the
        procedures are adjusted accordingly. What to do when a child goes missing from a whole group outing may be
        a little different, as parents usually attend and are responsible for their own child.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>As soon as it is noticed that a child is missing, the staff members on the outing ask children to stand with
          their designated carer and carry out a headcount to ensure that no other child has gone astray.</li>
        <li>One staff member searches the immediate vicinity, but does not search beyond that.</li>
        <li>Our senior staff member on the outing contacts the police and reports that child as missing.
        </li>
        <li>Our manager is contacted immediately (if not on the outing) and the incident is recorded.
        </li>
        <li>Our manager contacts the parent(s).</li>

        <li>Our staff take the remaining children back to the setting as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>According to the advice of the police, a senior member of staff, or our manager where applicable, should
          remain at the site where the child went missing and wait for the police to arrive</li>
        <li>A recent photo and a description of what the child is wearing is given to the police.</li>
        <li>Our manager contacts our director and reports the incident. Our director comes to our premises
          immediately to carry out an investigation, with our management team (where appropriate)].</li>
        <li>Our staff keep calm and do not let the other children become anxious or worried.</li>

      </ul>
      <p><em>The investigation</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ofsted are informed as soon as possible and kept up-to-date with the investigation.</li>
        <li>Our director carries out a full investigation, taking written statements from all our staff and volunteers
          who
          were present.</li>
        <li>Our manager, together with our owner and other management team speaks with the parent(s) and
          explains the process of the investigation.</li>
        <li>The parent(s) may also raise a complaint with us or Ofsted.</li>
        <li>Each member of staff present writes an incident report detailing.<br>

          - The date and time of the incident.<br>
          - Where the child went missing from e.g. the setting or an outing venue.<br>
          - Which staff/children were in the premises/on the outing and the name of the staff member who was
          designated as responsible for the missing child.<br>
          - When the child was last seen in the premises/or on the outing, including the time it is estimated that the
          child went missing.<br>
          - What has taken place in the premises or on the outing since the child went missing.<br>
          - The report is counter-signed by the senior member of staff and the date and time added
        </li>

        <li>A conclusion is drawn as to how the breach of security happened.</li>
        <li>If the incident warrants a police investigation, all our staff co-operate fully. In this case, the police
          will
          handle all aspects of the investigation, including interviewing staff and parents. Children’s social care may
          be involved if it seems likely that there is a child protection issue to address.</li>
        <li>In the event of disciplinary action needing to be taken, Ofsted are advised</li>
        <li>The insurance provider is informed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Managing people</em></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Missing child incidents are very worrying for all concerned. Part of managing the incident is to try to keep
          everyone as calm as possible.</li>
        <li>Our staff will feel worried about the child, especially the key person or the designated carer responsible
          for
          the safety of that child for the outing. They may blame themselves and their feelings of anxiety and distress
          will rise as the length of time the child is missing increases.</li>
        <li>They may be the understandable target of parental anger and they may be afraid. Our manager ensures
          that any staff under investigation are not only fairly treated, but receive support while feeling vulnerable.
        </li>

        <li>The parents will feel angry, and fraught. They may want to blame our staff and may single out one staff
          member over others; they may direct their anger at our manager. When dealing with a distraught and
          angry parent, there should always be two members of staff one of whom is our manager and the other
          should be our director . No matter how understandable the parent’s anger may be, aggression or threats
          against our staff are not tolerated, and the police should be called.</li>
        <li>The other children are also sensitive to what is going on around them. They too may be worried. Our
          remaining staff caring for them need to be focused on their needs and must not discuss the incident in front
          of them. They should answer children’s questions honestly, but also reassure them.</li>
        <li>In accordance with the severity of the final outcome, our staff may need counselling and support. If a child
          is not found, or is injured, or worse, this will be a very difficult time. Our director will use their
          discretion to
          decide what action to take.</li>
        <li>Our staff must not discuss any missing child incident with the press without taking advice and adhere to
          our confidentiality policy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Policy statement</h2>
      <p>We have record keeping systems in place that meet legal requirements; the means we use to store and share that
        information take place within the framework of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) (2018) and the
        Human Rights Act (1998).</p>
      <p>This policy and procedure should be read alongside our Privacy Notice, Confidentiality and Client Access to
        Records Policy and our Information Sharing Policy</p>
      <h2>Procedures</h2>
      <p>If a child attends another setting, we establish a regular two-way flow of appropriate information with parents
        and
        other providers. Where appropriate, we will incorporate comments from other providers, as well as parents and/or
        carers into the child’s records.
      </p>
      <p>We keep two kinds of records of children attending our setting</p>
      <p><em>Developmental records</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>These include observations of children in the setting, photographs, video clips and samples of their work
          and
          summary developmental reports.</li>
        <li>These are usually kept in our Blossom Management software system and some hard copies are kept in a file
          in a filing cabinet and can be accessed, and contributed to, by our staff, the child and the child’s parents.
        </li>

      </ul>
      <p><em>Personal records</em></p>
      <p>These may include the following (as applicable):</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Personal details – including the child’s registration form and any consent forms.</li>
        <li>Contractual matters – including a copy of the signed parent contract, the child’s days and times of
          attendance,
          a record of the child’s fees, any fee reminders or records of disputes about fees.</li>
        <li>Child’s development, health and well-being – including a summary only of the child’s EYFS profile report, a
          record of discussions about every day matters about the child’s development health and well-bring with the
          parent.
        </li>
        <li>Early Support – including any additional focussed intervention provided by [our/my] setting (e.g. support
          for
          behaviour, language or development that needs an SEN action plan) and records of any meetings held.
        </li>
        <li>Welfare and child protection concerns – including records of all welfare and protection concerns, and
          [our/my]
          resulting action, meetings and telephone conversations about the child, an Education, Health and Care Plan
          and any information regarding a Looked After Child.</li>

        <li>Correspondence and Reports – including a copy of the child’s 2 Year Old Progress Check (as applicable), all
          letters and emails to and from other agencies and any confidential reports from other agencies.</li>
        <li>These confidential records are stored in a lockable file or cabinet, which is always locked when not in use
          and
          which our manager keeps secure in an office or other suitably safe place.</li>
        <li>We read any correspondence in relation to a child, note any actions and file it immediately</li>
        <li>We ensure that access to children’s files is restricted to those authorised to see them and make entries in
          them, this being [our manager, deputy or designated person for child protection, the child’s key person, or
          other staff as authorised by our manager and other staff as authorised by me.</li>
        <li>We may be required to hand children’s personal files to Ofsted as part of an inspection or investigation
          process; or to local authority staff conducting an S11 audit, as long as authorisation is seen. We ensure that
          children’s personal files are not handed over to anyone else to look at.</li>
        <li>Parents have access, in accordance with our Privacy Notice, Confidentiality and Client Access to Records
          Policy, to the files and records of their own children, but do not have access to information about any other
          child.</li>
        <li>Our staff will not discuss personal information given by parents with other members of staff, except where
          it
          affects planning for the child's needs. Our staff induction programme includes an awareness of the importance
          of confidentiality in the role of the key person.</li>
        <li>We retain children’s records for three years after they have left the setting; except records that relate to
          an
          accident or child protection matter, which are kept until a child reaches the age of 21 years or 24 years
          respectively. These are kept in a secure place.</li>

      </ul>
      <p><em>Archiving children’s files</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>When a child leaves our setting, we remove all paper documents from the child’s personal file and place them
          in a locked cupboard. We seal this and place it in an archive box, stored in a safe place (i.e. a locked
          cabinet)
          for three years. After three years it is destroyed.</li>
        <li>If data is kept electronically it is encrypted and stored as above.</li>
        <li>Where there were s.47 child protection investigations, we mark the envelope with a star and archived it for
          7
          years. We keep all children’s files for 7 years before destroying them safely.</li>
        <li>We store financial information according to our finance procedures.</li>

      </ul>
      <p><em>Other Records</em></p>

      <ul>
        <li>We keep a daily record of the names of the children we are caring for, their hours of attendance and the
          names of their key person.</li>
        <li>Students on Early Years Alliance or other recognised qualifications and training, when they are observing in
          the setting, are advised of our Confidentiality and Client Access to Records Policy and are required to
          respect
          it.</li>

      <h2>Policy statement</h2>
      <p>We meet the Safeguarding and Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage, ensuring that our
        staff and volunteers are appropriately qualified, and we carry out checks for criminal and other records through
        the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) in accordance with statutory requirements.</p>

      <p><em>Vetting and staff selection</em></p>

      <ul>
        <li>We work towards offering equality of opportunity by using non-discriminatory procedures for staff
          recruitment and selection.</li>
        <li>All our staff have job descriptions, which set out their roles and responsibilities.</li>
        <li>We welcome applications from all sections of the community. Applicants will be considered on the basis of
          their suitability for the post, regardless of disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race,
          religion or belief, sexual orientation, sex, age, marriage or civil partnership. Applicants will not be placed
          at
          a disadvantage by [our/my] imposing conditions or requirements that are not justifiable.</li>
        <li>We follow the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage and Ofsted guidance on checking the
          suitability of all staff and volunteers who will have unsupervised access to children. This includes obtaining
          references and ensuring they have a satisfactory enhanced criminal records check with barred list(s) check
          through the DBS. This is in accordance with requirements under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act
          (2006) and the Protection of Freedoms Act (2012) for the vetting and barring scheme.</li>
        <li>Where an individual is subscribed to the DBS Update Service we carry out a status check of their DBS
          certificate, after checking their identity and viewing their original enhanced DBS certificate to ensure that
          it
          does not reveal any information that would affect their suitability for the post. We obtain this before their
          start of employment.</li>
        <li>We keep all records relating to the employment of our staff and volunteers; in particular those
          demonstrating that suitability checks have been done, including the date of issue, name, and type of DBS</li>
        <li>We require that all our staff and volunteers keep their DBS check up-to-date by subscribing to the DBS
          Update Service throughout the duration of their employment with us.</li>
        <li>Our staff are expected to disclose any convictions, cautions, court orders, reprimands and warnings which
          may affect their suitability to work with children – whether received before, or at any time during, their
          employment with us.</li>
        <li>We obtain consent from our staff and volunteers to carry out on-going status checks of the Update Service
          to establish that their DBS certificate is up-to-date for the duration of their employment with us</li>

        <li>Where we become aware of any relevant information which may lead to the disqualification of an
          employee, we will take appropriate action to ensure the safety of children. In the event of disqualification,
          that person’s employment with us will be terminated.</li>

        <li>If a member of staff is taking medication which may affect their ability to care for children, we ensure
          that
          they seek further medical advice. Our staff will only work directly with the children if medical advice
          confirms that the medication is unlikely to impair their ability to look after children properly.</li>

      <h2>Policy statement</h2>
      <p>We ensure the highest possible standard of fire precautions is in place. The person in charge and our staff are
        familiar with the current legal requirements. Where necessary we seek the advice of a competent person, such
        as our Fire Officer or Fire Safety Consultant. A Fire Safety Log Book is used to record the findings of risk
        assessment, any actions taken or incidents that have occurred and our fire drills. Downloadable Fire Safety
        Log Books are widely available free of charge on line. We ensure our policy is in line with the procedures
        specific to our building, making reasonable adjustments as required.</p>



      <h2>Procedures</h2>
      <p><em>Fire safety risk assessment</em></p>

      <ul>
        <li>The basis of fire safety is risk assessment, carried out by a ‘competent person’.</li>
        <li>

          The manager has received training in fire safety sufficient to be competent to carry out the risk
          assessment; this will be written where there are more than five staff and will follow the Government
          guidance Fire Safety Risk Assessment - Educational Premises (HMG 2006).<br>
          - Our fire safety risk assessment focuses on the following for each area of the setting:<br>
          - Electrical plugs, wires<br>
          - Electrical items.<br>
          - Gas boilers.<br>
          - Cookers.<br>
          - Matches.<br>
          - Candles<br>
          - Flammable materials – including furniture, furnishings, paper etc. <br>
          - Flammable chemicals.<br>
          - Means of escape.<br>
          - Anything else identified.

        </li>
        <li>Where we rent premises, we will ensure that we have a copy of the fire safety risk assessment that applies
          to the building and that we contribute to regular reviews.</li>
        <li><em>Fire safety precautions taken</em></li>
        <li>We ensure that fire doors are clearly marked, never obstructed and easily opened from the inside.</li>
        <li>We ensure that smoke detectors/alarms and fire fighting appliances conform to BS EN standards, are fitted
          in appropriate high risk areas of the building and are checked as specified by the manufacturer.</li>
        <li>We have all electrical equipment checked annually by a registered PAT person. Any faulty electrical
          equipment is taken out of use and either repaired or replaced.</li>
        <li>Our emergency evacuation procedures are approved by the Fire Safety Officer and are:
          - clearly displayed on the premises;<br>
          - explained to new members of staff volunteers and parents; and<br>
          - practised regularly, at least once every six weeks.</li>
        <li>Records are kept of fire drills and of the servicing of fire safety equipment.</li>


        <p><em>Emergency evacuation procedure</em></p>


        <li>Every setting is different and the evacuation procedure will be suitable for each setting. It must cover
          procedures for practice drills including:</li>
        <li>How children are familiar with the sound of the fire alarm</li>
        <li>How the children, staff and parents know where the fire exits are.</li>
        <li>How children are led from the building to the assembly point.</li>
        <li>How children will be accounted for and who by.</li>
        <li>How long does it take to get the children out safely?</li>
        <li>Who calls the emergency services, and when, in the event of a real fire</li>
        <li>How parents are contacted.</li>

      </ul>
      <p><em>Fire drills</em></p>
      <p>We hold fire drills termly or as when a new member staff joins our setting and record the following information
        about each fire drill in the Fire Safety Log Book:</p>


      <ul>
        <li>The date and time of the drill.</li>
        <li>Number of adults and children involved.</li>
        <li>How long it takes to evacuate</li>
        <li>Whether there were any problems that delayed evacuation.</li>
        <li>Any further action taken to improve the drill procedure.</li>

      <h3>Acting to Safeguard Children</h3>
      <p><strong>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Child Protection</strong></p>
      <p>
        The safeguarding policy and procedures must include an explanation of the action to be taken in the event
        of an allegation being made against a member of staff, and cover the use of mobile phones and cameras in
        the setting.
      </p>

      <div class="section-title">Purpose</div>
      <p>
        To ensure the safety, privacy, and wellbeing of all children in our care, this policy outlines the restrictions
        on mobile phone use by parents and visitors within the nursery premises. It is in accordance with Ofsted
        safeguarding guidance and statutory requirements under the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS).
      </p>

      <div class="section-title">Policy Statement</div>
      <ul>
        <li>The use of mobile phones, smart devices, or any equipment capable of capturing images or videos is strictly
          prohibited within all areas of the nursery where children are present.</li>

      </ul>

      <div class="section-title">Rationale</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Ofsted requires early years settings to implement robust safeguarding measures, including policies that
          govern the use of mobile phones and cameras.</li>
        <li>The presence of mobile devices poses a potential risk to children’s privacy and safety, particularly
          regarding the unauthorized capture or sharing of images.</li>
        <li>This policy supports our commitment to creating a focused, respectful, and secure environment for all
          children.</li>

        <li>Parents and visitors must switch off or silence their mobile phones before entering the nursery.</li>
        <li>If a call must be taken or made, we kindly ask that you step outside the building.</li>
        <li>Staff are instructed to politely remind parents of this policy when necessary.</li>
        <li>In cases of repeated non-compliance, management reserves the right to address the issue formally.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="section-title">Exceptions</div>
      <p>
        Emergency situations may be discussed with the Nursery Manager, who will determine appropriate action.

        </div>

        <h2>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Information and Records</h2>
        <p>Providers must maintain records and obtain and share information to ensure the safe and efficient management
          of the setting, and to ensure the needs of all children are met.</p>

        <h2>10.5 Parental involvement</h2>

        <h3>Policy statement</h3>
        <p>We believe that children benefit most from early years education and care when parents and settings work
          together in partnership.</p>

        <p>Our aim is to support parents as their children's first and most important educators by involving them in
          their children's education and in the full life of our setting. We also aim to support parents in their own
          continuing education and personal development.</p>

        <p>Some parents are less well represented in early years settings; these include fathers, parents who live apart
          from their children, but who still play a part in their lives, as well as working parents. In carrying out the
          following procedures, we will ensure that all parents are included.</p>

        <p>When we refer to 'parents', we mean both mothers and fathers; these include both natural or birth parents, as
          well as step-parents and parents who do not live with their children but have contact with them and play a
          part in their lives. 'Parents' also includes same sex parents, as well as foster parents.</p>

        <p>The Children Act (1989) defines parental responsibility as 'all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities
          and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property'. (For a full
          explanation of who has parental responsibility, refer to the Safeguarding Children (Pre-school Learning
          Alliance 2013.)</p>

        <h3>Procedures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents are made to feel welcome in our setting; they are greeted appropriately, and there is adult
            seating and provision for refreshments.</li>
          <li>We have a means to ensure all parents are included - that may mean that we have different strategies for
            involving fathers or parents who work or live apart from their children.</li>
          <li>We make every effort to accommodate parents who have a disability or impairment.</li>
          <li>We consult with all parents to find out what works best for them.</li>
          <li>We ensure on-going dialogue with parents to improve our knowledge of the needs of their children and to
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="page-break">
          <h3>Continued Procedures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>We inform all parents about how the setting is run and its policies, through access to written
              information, including our Safeguarding Children and Child Protection policy and our responsibilities
              under the Prevent Duty, and through regular informal communication. We check to ensure parents understand
              the information that is given to them. We update our Policies regularly and share them with Parents on our
              Blossom App.</li>
            <li>Information about a child and his or her family is kept confidential within our setting. We provide you
              with a privacy notice that details how and why we process your personal information. The exception to this
              is where there is cause to believe that a child may be suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant
              harm, or where there are concerns regarding child's development that need to be shared with another
              agency. We will seek parental permission unless there are reasons not to in order to protect the safety of
              the child. Reference is made to our Information Sharing Policy on seeking consent for disclosure.</li>
            <li>We seek specific parental consent to administer medication, take a child for emergency treatment, take a
              child on an outing and take photographs for the purposes of record keeping and social media.</li>
            <li>The expectations that we make on parents are made clear at the point of registration.</li>
            <li>We make clear our expectation that parents will participate in settling their child at the commencement
              of a place according to an agreed plan.</li>
            <li>We seek parents' views regarding changes in the delivery of our service.</li>
            <li>Parents are actively encouraged to participate in decision-making processes according to the structure
              in place within our setting.</li>
            <li>We encourage parents to become involved in the social and cultural life of the setting and actively
              contribute to it.</li>
            <li>As far as possible our service is provided in a flexible way to meet the needs of parents without
              compromising the needs of children.</li>
            <li>We provide sufficient opportunity for parents to share necessary information with staff and this is
              recorded and stored to protect confidentiality. We use blossom app to share information.</li>
            <li>Our key persons meet regularly with parents to discuss their child's progress and to share concerns if
              they arise.</li>
            <li>Where applicable, our key persons work with parents to carry out an agreed plan to support special
              educational needs.</li>

        <h1>Looked After Children Policy 2025</h1>
        <p class="provider-name">Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Child Protection</h2>
      <p>Providers must have and implement a policy, and procedures, to safeguard children.</p>

      <h2>1.3 Looked after children</h2>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h3>Policy statement</h3>
        <p>We are committed to providing quality provision based on equality of opportunity for all children and their
          families. All staff in our provision are committed to doing all they can to enable 'looked after' children in
          our care to achieve and reach their full potential.</p>

        <p>Children become 'looked after' if they have either been taken into care by the local authority, or have been
          accommodated by the local authority (a voluntary care arrangement). Most looked after children will be living
          in foster homes, but a smaller number may be in a children's home, living with a relative or even placed back
          home with their natural parent(s).</p>

        <p>We recognise that children who are being looked after have often experienced traumatic situations; physical,
          emotional or sexual abuse or neglect. However, we also recognise that not all looked after children have
          experienced abuse and that there are a range of reasons for children to be taken in to the care of the local
          authority. Whatever the reason, a child's separation from their home and family signifies a disruption in
          their lives that has an impact on their emotional well-being. Most local authorities do not place children
          under five with foster carers who work outside the home; however, there are instances when this does occur or
          where the child has been placed with another family member who works. It is not appropriate for a looked after
          child who is under two years to be placed in a day care setting in addition to a foster placement.</p>

        <p>We place emphasis on promoting children's right to be strong, resilient and listened to. Our policy and
          practice guidelines for looked after children are based on two important concepts: attachment and resilience.
          The basis of this is to promote secure attachments in children's lives, as the foundation for resilience.
          These aspects of well-being underpin the child's responsiveness to learning and enable the development of
          positive dispositions for learning. For young children to get the most out of educational opportunities they
          need to be settled enough with their carer to be able to cope with further separation, a new environment and
          new expectations made upon them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="principles-section">
        <h3>Principles</h3>
        <p>The term 'looked after child' denotes a child's current legal status; this term is never used to categorise a
          child as standing out from others. We do not refer to such a child using acronyms such as LAC.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We do not normally offer placements for babies and children under two years who are in care; we offer
            instead other services to enable a child to play and engage with other children while their carer stays with
            them.</li>
          <li>In exceptional circumstances, we offer places to two-year-old children who are in care. In such cases, the
            child should have been with the foster carer for at least two months and show signs of having formed a
            secure attachment to the carer, and the placement in the setting will last a minimum of three months.</li>
          <li>We offer places for funded three and four-year-olds who are in care to ensure they receive their
            entitlement to early education. We expect that a child will have been with a foster carer for a minimum of
            one month and that they will have formed a secure attachment to the carer. We expect that the placement in
            the setting will last a minimum of six weeks.</li>
          <li>We will always offer 'stay and play' provision for a child who is two to five years old who is still
            settling with their foster carer, or who is only temporarily being looked after.</li>
          <li>Where a child who normally attends our setting is taken into care and is cared for by a local foster
            carer, we will continue to offer the placement for the child.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="page-break">
        <div class="procedures-section">
          <h3>Procedures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The designated person for looked after children is the designated child protection co-ordinator.</li>
            <li>Every child is allocated a key person before they start and this is no different for a looked after
              child. The designated person ensures the key person has the information, support and training necessary to
              meet the looked after child's needs.</li>
            <li>The designated person and the key person liaise with agencies, professionals and practitioners involved
              with the child and his or her family and ensure that appropriate information is gained and shared.</li>
            <li>The setting recognises the role of the local authority children's social care department as the child's
              'corporate parent' and the key agency in determining what takes place with the child. Nothing changes,
              especially with regard to the birth parent's or foster carer's role in relation to the setting, without
              prior discussion and agreement with the child's social worker.</li>
            <li>At the start of a placement there is a professional's meeting to determine the objectives of the
              placement and draw up a care plan that incorporates the child's learning needs. This plan is reviewed
              after two weeks, six weeks and three months. Thereafter at three to six monthly intervals.</li>
            <li>The care plan needs to consider issues for the child such as:
              <ul>
                <li>their emotional needs and how they are to be met;</li>
                <li>how any emotional issues and problems that affect behaviour are to be managed;</li>
                <li>their sense of self, culture, language(s) and identity – and how this is to be supported;</li>
                <li>their need for sociability and friendship;</li>
                <li>their interests and abilities and possible learning journey pathway; and</li>
                <li>how any special needs will be supported.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In addition the care plan will also consider:
              <ul>
                <li>how information will be shared with the foster carer and local authority (as the 'corporate parent')
                  as well as what information is shared with whom and how it will be recorded and stored;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="page-break">
        <div class="procedures-section">
          <ul>
            <li>what contact the child has with his/her birth parent(s) and what arrangements will be in place for
              supervised contact. If this is to be at the setting, when, where and what form the contact will take will
              be discussed and agreed;</li>
            <li>what written reporting is required;</li>
            <li>wherever possible, and where the plan is for the child to return home, the birth parent(s) should be
              involved in planning; and</li>
            <li>with the social worker's agreement, and as part of the plan, the birth parent(s) should be involved in
              the setting's activities that include parents, such as outings and fun-days etc alongside the foster
              carer.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The settling-in process for the child is agreed. It should be the same as for any other child, with the
            foster carer taking the place of the parent, unless otherwise agreed. It is even more important that the
            'proximity' stage is followed until it is visible that the child has formed a sufficient relationship with
            his or her key person for them to act as a 'secure base' to allow the gradual separation from the foster
            carer. This process may take longer in some cases, so time needs to be allowed for it to take place without
            causing further distress or anxiety to the child.</p>

          <p>In the first two weeks after settling-in, the child's well-being is the focus of observation, their
            sociability and their ability to manage their feelings with or without support.</p>

          <p>Further observations about communication, interests and abilities will be noted to form a picture of the
            whole child in relation to the Early Years Foundation Stage prime and specific areas of learning and
            development.</p>

          <p>Concerns about the child will be noted in the child's file and discussed with the foster carer.</p>

          <p>If the concerns are about the foster carer's treatment of the child, or if abuse is suspected, these are
            recorded in the child's file and reported to the child's social worker according to the setting's
            safeguarding children procedure.</p>

          <p>Regular contact should be maintained with the social worker through planned meetings that will include the
            foster carer.</p>

          <p>The transition to school will be handled sensitively. The designated person and/or the child's key person
            will liaise with the school, passing on relevant information and documentation with the agreement of the
            child's social worker as detailed in the care plan.</p>

        <p>No child is excluded from participating in our setting who may, for any reason, not yet be toilet trained and
          who may still be wearing nappies or equivalent. We work with parents towards toilet training, unless there are
          medical or other developmental reasons why this may not be appropriate at the time.</p>

        <p>We provide nappy changing facilities and exercise good hygiene practices in order to accommodate children who
          are not yet toilet trained.</p>

            They must leave the door open to the toilet but given children privacy for when changing nappies and
            clothes.</li>
          <li>We encourage young children from two years to normally wear pull ups, or other types of trainer pants, as
            soon as they are comfortable with this and if their parents agree.</li>
          <li>Babies and young children are changed within sight of other staff whilst maintaining their dignity and

            eyes.</li>
          <li>Each child has their own basket to hand with their nappies or pull ups and changing wipes.</li>
          <li>Our staff put on gloves and aprons before changing starts and the areas are prepared. Baby wipes are put
            down on the changing mat freshly for each child. Gloves are not always required for a wet nappy where there
            is no risk of infection, however, gloves are always available for those staff who choose to wear them.
            Gloves are always work for a 'soiled' nappy.</li>
          <li>All our staff are familiar with our hygiene procedures and carry these out when changing nappies. They

          <li>Our staff never turn their back on a child or leave them unattended whilst they are on the changing mat.
          </li>
          <li>We are gentle when changing; we avoid pulling faces and making negative comments about 'nappy contents'.
          </li>
          <li>We do not make inappropriate comments about children's genitals when changing their nappies.</li>

            <li>In addition, we ensure that nappy changing is relaxed and a time to promote independence in young
              children.</li>
            <li>We encourage children to take an interest in using the toilet; they may just want to sit on it and talk
              to a friend who is also using the toilet.</li>
            <li>We encourage children to wash their hands, and have soap and towels to hand. They should be allowed time
              for some play as they explore the water and the soap and talk to them as to the reasons why they have to
              flush the toilet and wash hands after toileting.</li>
            <li>We do not use anti-bacterial hand wash liquid or soap for young children; young skin is quite delicate
              and anti-bacterial products kill off certain good bacteria that children need to develop their own natural
              resistance to infection.</li>
            <li>Older children access the toilet when they have the need to and are encouraged to be independent.</li>
            <li>We dispose of nappies and pull ups hygienically. Any soil (faeces) in nappies or pull ups is never
              flushed but put in nappy sacks and put in the bin. Cloth nappies, trainer pants and ordinary pants that
              have been wet or soiled are bagged for parents to take home.</li>
            <li>We have a 'duty of care' towards children's personal needs. If children are left in wet or soiled
              nappies/pull ups in the setting this may constitute neglect and will be a disciplinary matter.</li>

            <li>If an incident occurs before any children arrive, our manager risk assesses this situation and decides

            <li>Where an incident occurs whilst the children are in our care and it is necessary to evacuate the

          <p>In the event of a terrorist attack, we follow the advice of the emergency services with regard to

        <p class="provider-name">Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Safety and Suitability of Premises, Environment and Equipment</h2>
      <p>Providers must ensure that they take all reasonable steps to ensure staff and children in their care are not
        exposed to risks and must be able to demonstrate how they are managing risks.</p>

      <h2>8.4 Risk assessment</h2>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h3>Policy statement</h3>
        <p>We believe that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance. We make our setting a safe and
          healthy place for children, parents, staff and volunteers by assessing and minimising the hazards and risks to
          enable the children to thrive in a healthy and safe environment.</p>

        <p>Risk assessment means: <em>Taking note of aspects of your workplace and activities that could cause harm,
            either to yourself or to others, and deciding what needs to be done to prevent that harm, making sure this
            is adhered to.</em></p>

        <p>The law does not require that all risk is eliminated, but that 'reasonable precaution' is taken. This is
          particularly important when balancing the need for children to be able to take appropriate risks through
          physically challenging play. Children need the opportunity to work out what is not safe and what they should
          do when faced with a risk.</p>

        <p>Health and safety risk assessments inform procedures. Staff and parents should be involved in reviewing risk
          assessments and procedures – they are the ones with first-hand knowledge as to whether the control measures
          are effective – and they can give an informed view to help update procedures accordingly.</p>

        <div class="five-steps">
          <h3>This policy is based on the five steps below:</h3>
          <div class="step">
            <p><span class="highlight">1. Identification of a risk:</span> Where is it and what is it?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <p><span class="highlight">2. Who is at risk:</span> Childcare staff, children, parents, cooks, cleaners
              etc?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <p><span class="highlight">3. Assessment as to whether the level of a risk is high, medium, low.</span> This
              takes into account both the likelihood of it happening, as well as the possible impact if it did.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <p><span class="highlight">4. Control measures to reduce/eliminate risk:</span> What will you need to do, or
              ensure others will do, in order to reduce that risk?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <p><span class="highlight">5. Monitoring and review:</span> How do you know if what you have said is
              working, or is thorough enough? If it is not working, it will need to be amended, or maybe there is a
              better solution.</p>

      <h2>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Child Protection/Safeguarding</h2>
      <p>Providers must have and implement a policy, and procedures, to safeguard children, young people and vulnerable
        adults</p>

      <h2>1.2 Safeguarding children, young people and vulnerable adults</h2>
      <p>(Including managing allegations of abuse against a member of staff)</p>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h3>Policy statement</h3>
        <p>Our setting will work with children, parents and the community to ensure the rights and safety of children
          and young people* and vulnerable adults to give them the very best start in life. Our safeguarding policy is
          based on the three key commitments.</p>

        <p>This policy is in line with statutory guidance for schools/settings and colleges; Keeping Child Safe in
          Education (2016), Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) (2017) Working Together to Safeguard Children (2015),
          London Child Protection Procedures (5th Edition), 'What to do if You are Worried a Child is Being Abused' 2015
          and Ofsted guidance 'Inspecting safeguarding in early years, education and skills' (2016)</p>

        <p>The statutory guidance <strong>Keeping Children Safe in Education 2016</strong> is issued under Section 175
          of the Education Act 2002, the Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2014 and the Education
          (Non-Maintained Special Schools) (England) Regulations 2011. Schools and colleges must have regard to this
          guidance when carrying out their duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Other childcare
          providers may also find it helpful to refer to this guidance. Unless otherwise stated, 'school' in this
          guidance means all schools, whether maintained, non-maintained or independent, including academies and free
          schools, alternative provision academies and pupil referral units. 'School' includes maintained nursery
          schools. 'College' means further education colleges and sixth form colleges as established under the Further
          and Higher Education Act 1992. And relates to their responsibilities to children under the age of 18 (but
          excludes 16-19 academies and free schools, which are required to comply with relevant safeguarding legislation
          by virtue of their funding agreement)</p>

        <h1>Staff Attendance and Lateness Policy 2025</h1>
        <p class="provider-name">Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd</p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Attendance Standard</h2>
        <p>Regular attendance is a vital part of fulfilling your duties as a member of the Bright Kids Day nursery team.
          Absence from work places a strain on other members of staff at the nursery, unsettles the children, and
          generally disrupts the smooth running of the nursery as a whole.</p>

        <p>While it is sometimes necessary to be absent from work for serious illness, it is your responsibility to take
          care of your health to ensure that you are not regularly absent from the nursery.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedure for attendance</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>If employees are to work before their shift, staff must ensure they inform the nursery at the earliest
            convenience. Employees are expected to inform management before 7.00 am. Employees must inform the Manager
            on their personal phone before 7.30 am. After 7.30 am employee must call the nursery phone.</li>
          <li>When absent for more than one working day, staff must notify management by 3pm the day before. If staff
            fail to do this, the nursery has the right to decline them from working.</li>
          <li>When the staff members return to work, they must complete an absence statement. Proof of absence may be
            essential.</li>
          <li>Staff are not paid for absence, but in some cases, statutory Sick Pay SSP.</li>
          <li>Regular Absence: 3 or more occasions of absence over the course of 3 months are seen as a failure to meet
            policies and procedures regarding absence. This includes any periods for which a doctor's sick certification
            is given.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When a staff member fails to meet expectations the sickness disciplinary action will be introduced to monitor
          attendance. All staff members' health, personal and emotional needs will be considered at each stage of the
          disciplinary.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stages-section">
        <h2>Stages of Sickness:</h2>

        <div class="stage">
          <h3>Stage 1:</h3>
          <p>A verbal warning and attendance will be closely monitored.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
          <h3>Stage 2:</h3>
          <p>If the employee is absent 2 or more times from the date placed on stage one and the next three months, then
            a written warning will be issued.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stage">
          <h3>Stage 3:</h3>
          <p>If the employee does not improve attendance, then dismissal may be necessary.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Staff can be removed from stage 1 or 2 following a 6-month monitoring period.</p>

        <p>Further information is found in the staff handbook.</p>

      <h2>5.1 Staffing</h2>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h3>Policy statement</h3>
        <p>We provide a staffing ratio in line with the Safeguarding and Welfare Requirements of the Early Years
          Foundation Stage to ensure that children have sufficient individual attention and to guarantee care and
          education of a high quality. Our staff are appropriately qualified and we carry out checks for criminal and

            a relationship. The main key person plans with parents for the child's well-being and development in the
            setting. The main key person meets regularly with the family for discussion and consultation on their
            child's progress and offers support in guiding their development at home.</li>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h3>Policy statement</h3>
        <p>Our setting recognises that qualifications and training make an important contribution to the quality of the
          care and education provided by early years providers. As part of our commitment to quality, we offer
          placements to students undertaking early years qualifications and training. We also offer placements for
          school pupils on work experience.</p>

        <p>We aim to provide for students on placement with us, experiences that contribute to the successful completion
          of their studies and that provide examples of quality practice in early years care and education.</p>

        <h3>Procedures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We require students on qualification courses to meet the 'suitable people' requirements of Ofsted and have
            DBS checks carried out or a risk assessment in place if they do not have a DBS.</li>
          <li>We require students in our setting to have a sufficient understanding and use of English to contribute to
            the well-being of children in our care.</li>

          <li>Trainee staff employed by the setting and students over the age of 17 may be included in the ratios if
            they are deemed competent and responsible.</li>
          <li>We take out employers' liability insurance and public liability insurance, which covers both trainees and
            voluntary helpers.</li>
          <li>We require students to keep to our confidentiality policy.</li>

        <p>Where applicable: Our setting does not have direct access to outdoor provision on the premises and will need
          to take children out daily. We ensure that there are procedures to keep children safe on outings; all staff

          <li>We ask parents to sign a general consent on registration for their children to be taken out on local short
            outings as a part of the daily activities of the setting. This general consent details the venues used for
            daily activities.</li>

      <h1>The Role of the Key Person and Settling In Policy</h1>

      <div class="header-info">
        Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd<br>
        Adopted: 25/08/2025 | To be reviewed: 25/08/2026
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Key Person</h2>
        <p>Each child must be assigned a key person. Their role is to help ensure that every child's care is tailored to
          meet their individual needs, to help the child become familiar with the setting, offer a settled relationship
          for the child and build a relationship with their parents.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>4.1 The role of the key person and settling-in</h2>

      <h3>Policy statement</h3>
      <p>We believe that children settle best when they have a key person to relate to, who knows them and their parents
        well, and who can meet their individual needs. Research shows that a key person approach benefits the child, the
        parents, the staff and the setting by providing secure relationships in which children thrive, parents have
        confidence, staff are committed and the setting is a happy and dedicated place to attend or work in.</p>

      <p>We want children to feel safe, stimulated and happy in the setting and to feel secure and comfortable with
        staff. We also want parents to have confidence in both their children's well-being and their role as active
        partners with the setting.</p>

      <p>We aim to make the setting a welcoming place where children settle quickly and easily because consideration has
        been given to the individual needs and circumstances of children and their families.</p>

      <p>The key person role is set out in the Safeguarding and Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation
        Stage. Each setting must assign a key person for each child at the point of entry to the setting.</p>

      <p>The procedures set out a model for developing a key person approach that promotes effective and positive
        relationships for children who are in settings.</p>

      <h3>Procedures</h3>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>We allocate a key person before the child starts.</li>
        <li>The key person is responsible for the induction of the family and for settling the child into our setting.
        </li>
        <li>The key person offers unconditional regard for the child and is non-judgemental.</li>
        <li>The key person works with the parent to plan and deliver a personalised plan for the child's well-being,
          care and learning.</li>
        <li>The key person acts as the key contact for the parents and has links with other carers involved with the
          child, such as a childminder, and co-ordinates the sharing of appropriate information about the child's
          development with those carers.</li>
        <li>The key person is responsible for developmental records and for sharing information on a regular basis with
          the child's parents to keep those records up-to-date, reflecting the full picture of the child in our setting
          and at home.</li>
        <li>The key person encourages positive relationships between children in her/his key group, spending time with
          them as a group each day.</li>
        <li>We provide a back up buddy key person for every child so the child and the parents have a key contact in the
          absence of the child's key person.</li>
        <li>We promote the role of the key person as the child's primary carer in our setting, and as the basis for
          establishing relationships with other staff and children.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Settling-in</h3>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Before a child starts to attend the setting, we use a variety of ways to provide his/her parents with
          information. These include written information (including our prospectus and policies), displays about
          activities available within the setting, information days and evenings and individual meetings with parents.
        </li>
        <li>Before a child is enrolled, we provide opportunities for the child and his/her parents to visit the setting.
        </li>
        <li>We allocate a key person to each child and his/her family before she/he starts to attend; the key person
          welcomes and looks after the child and his/her parents at the child's first session and during the settling-in
          process.</li>
        <li>We will fill in our 'All about me' forms with the parent to find out about the child's starting point and
          link to development matters.</li>
        <li>We may offer a home visit by the person who will be the child's key person, to ensure all relevant
          information about the child can be made known.</li>
        <li>We use pre-start visits and the first session at which a child attends to explain and complete, with his/her
          parents, the child's registration records.</li>
        <li>When a child starts to attend, we explain the process of settling-in with his/her parents and jointly decide
          on the best way to help the child to settle into the setting.</li>
        <li>We have an expectation that the parent, carer or close relative, will stay for most of the session during
          the first week, gradually taking time away from their child, increasing this as and when the child is able to
          cope.</li>
        <li>Younger children will take longer to settle in, as will children who have not previously spent time away
          from home. Children who have had a period of absence may also need their parent to be on hand to re-settle
          them.</li>
        <li>We judge a child to be settled when they have formed a relationship with their key person; for example, the
          child looks for the key person when he/she arrives, goes to them for comfort and seems pleased to be with
          them. The child is also familiar with where things are and is pleased to see other children and participate in
          activities.</li>
        <li>When parents leave, we ask them to say goodbye to their child and explain that they will be coming back, and
          when.</li>
        <li>We recognise that some children will settle more readily than others but that some children who appear to
          settle rapidly are not ready to be left. We expect that the parent will honour the commitment to stay for at
          least the first week, or possibly longer, until their child can stay happily without them.</li>
        <li>We do not believe that leaving a child to cry will help them to settle any quicker. We believe that a
          child's distress will prevent them from learning and gaining the best from the setting.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right not to accept a child into the setting without a parent or carer if the child finds it
          distressing to be left. This is especially the case with very young children.</li>
        <li>Within the first four to six weeks of starting we discuss and work with the child's parents to begin to
          create their child's record of achievement.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The progress check at age two</h3>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>The key person carries out the progress check at age two in accordance with any local procedures that are in
          place and referring to the supporting guidance to the EYFS A Know How Guide: The EYFS progress check at age
          two and forms from our Local Authority.</li>
        <li>The progress checks will be done in partnership with the Parents/Carers.</li>
        <li>The progress check aims to review the child's development and ensures that parents have a clear picture of
          their child's development.</li>
        <li>Within the progress check, the key person will note areas where the child is progressing well and identify
          areas where progress is less than expected.</li>
        <li>The progress check will describe the actions that will be taken by the setting to address any developmental
          concerns (including working with other professionals where appropriate) as agreed with the parent(s).</li>
        <li>The key person will plan activities to meet the child's needs within the setting and will support parents to
          understand the child's needs in order to enhance their development at home.</li>

      <h3>Procedures</h3>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Parents are asked to provide the following specific information when their child starts attending our

          inform us in writing of how they can be contacted.</li>
        <li>On occasions when parents, or the persons normally authorised to collect the child, are not able to collect
          the child, they provide us with written details of the name, address and telephone number of the person who
          will be collecting their child. We agree with parents how to verify the identity of the person who is to
          collect their child.</li>

          </div>
        </li>

          <ul class="nested-list">
            <li>The child's file is checked for any information about changes to the normal collection routines.</li>
            <li>If no information is available, parents/carers are contacted at home or at work.</li>
            <li>If this is unsuccessful, the adults who are authorised by the parents to collect their child - and whose
              telephone numbers are recorded on the Registration Form - are contacted. We need 2 emergency contact
              details.</li>
            <li>All reasonable attempts are made to contact the parents or nominated carers.</li>
            <li>The child does not leave the premises with anyone other than those named on the Registration Form or in

            <li>If no-one collects the child within 30 minutes of their expected collection time and there is no named
              contact who can be contacted to collect the child, we apply the procedures for uncollected children.</li>
            <li>If we have any cause to believe the child has been abandoned we contact the local authority children's
              social care team:
              <div class="contact-info">
                If the children's social care team is unavailable [or as our local authority advise] we will contact the

              worker, or by another person specified by social care.</li>
            <li>Social care will aim to find the parent or relative. If they are unable to do so, the child will become
              looked after by the local authority.</li>
            <li>Under no circumstances will we go to look for the parent, nor leave the setting premises with the child.

      <h1>Valuing Diversity and Promoting Inclusion and Equality Policy</h1>

      <div class="header-info">
        Bright Kids Day Nursery / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd<br>
        Adopted: 12/09/2025 | To be reviewed: 12/09/2026
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Safeguarding and Welfare Requirement: Special educational needs</h2>
        <p>Providers must have arrangements in place to support children with SEN or disabilities.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>9.1 Valuing diversity and promoting inclusion and equality</h2>

      <h3>Policy statement</h3>
      <p>We are committed to ensuring that our service is fully inclusive in meeting the needs of all children.</p>

      <p>We recognise that children and their families come from a wide range of backgrounds with individual needs,
        beliefs and values. They may grow up in family structures that include one or two parents of the same or
        different sex. Children may have close links or live with extended families of grandparents, aunts, uncles and
        cousins; while other children may be more removed from close kin, or may live with other relatives or foster
        carers. Some children come from families who experience social exclusion, severe hardship; discrimination and
        prejudice because of their ethnicity, disability and/or ability, the languages they speak, their religious or
        personal beliefs, their sexual orientation and marital status. Some individuals face discrimination linked to
        their gender and some women are discriminated against because of their pregnancy and maternity status. We
        understand that all these factors can affect the well-being of children within these families and may adversely
        impact on children's learning, attainment and life outcomes.</p>

      <p>We are committed to anti-discriminatory practice to promote equality of opportunity and valuing diversity for
        all children and families using our setting. We aim to:</p>

      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Promote equality and value diversity within our service and foster good relations with the local community;
        </li>
        <li>Actively include all families and value the positive contribution they make to our service;</li>
        <li>Promote a positive non-stereotyping environment that promotes dignity, respect and understanding of
          difference in all forms;</li>
        <li>Provide a secure and accessible environment in which every child feels safe and equally included;</li>
        <li>Improve our knowledge and understanding of issues relating to anti-discriminatory practice,</li>
        <li>Challenge and eliminate discriminatory actions on the basis of a protected characteristic as defined by the
          Equality Act (2010) namely:
          <div class="equality-act">
            <ul class="nested-list">
              <li>age;</li>
              <li>gender;</li>
              <li>gender reassignment;</li>
              <li>marital status;</li>
              <li>pregnancy and maternity;</li>
              <li>race;</li>
              <li>disability;</li>
              <li>sexual orientation; and</li>
              <li>religion or belief.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>where possible, take positive action to benefit groups or individuals with protected characteristics who are
          disadvantaged, have a disproportional representation within the service or need different things from the
          service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Procedures</h3>

      <h4>Admissions</h4>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Our setting is open and accessible to all members of the community.</li>
        <li>We base our Admissions Policy on a fair system.</li>
        <li>We do not discriminate against a child or their family in our service provision, including preventing their

        <li>We advertise our service widely.</li>
        <li>We provide information in clear, concise language, whether in spoken or written form and provide information

        <li>We take action against any discriminatory, prejudice, harassing or victimising behaviour by our staff,
          volunteers or parents whether by:
          <ul class="nested-list">
            <li>Direct discrimination – someone is treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic e.g.
              preventing families of a specific ethnic group from using the service;</li>
            <li>Indirect discrimination – someone is affected unfavourably by a general policy e.g. children must only
              speak English in the setting;</li>
            <li>Discrimination arising from a disability – someone is treated less favourably because of something
              connected with their disability e.g. a child with a visual impairment is excluded from an activity;</li>
            <li>Association – discriminating against someone who is associated with a person with a protected
              characteristic e.g. behaving unfavourably to someone who is married to a person from a different cultural
              background; or</li>
            <li>Perception – discrimination on the basis that it is thought someone has a protected characteristic e.g.
              making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We will not tolerate behaviour from an adult who demonstrates dislike or prejudice towards individuals who are
        perceived to be from another country (xenophobia).</p>

      <p>Displaying of openly discriminatory xenophobic and possibly offensive or threatening materials, name-calling,
        or threatening behaviour is unacceptable on, or around, our premises and will be dealt with immediately and
        discreetly by asking the adult to stop using the unacceptable behaviour and inviting them to read and to act in
        accordance with the relevant policy statement and procedure. Failure to comply may lead to the adult being
        excluded from the premises.</p>

      <h4>Employment</h4>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>We advertise posts and all applicants are judged against explicit and fair criteria.</li>
        <li>Applicants are welcome from all backgrounds and posts are open to all.</li>
        <li>We may use the exemption clauses in relevant legislation to enable the service to best meet the needs of the
          community.</li>
        <li>The applicant who best meets the criteria is offered the post, subject to references and suitability checks.
          This ensures fairness in the selection process.</li>

          as part of their specifications.</li>

          Promoting Equality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Curriculum</h4>
      <p>The curriculum offered in our setting encourages children to develop positive attitudes about themselves as
        well as about people who are different from themselves. It encourages the development of confidence and
        self-esteem, empathy, critical thinking and reflection.</p>

      <p>We ensure that our practice is fully inclusive by:</p>
      <ul class="procedures-list">

        <li>Ensuring that children speaking languages other than English are supported in the maintenance and

      </ul>

      <p>We will ensure that Our environment is as accessible as possible for all visitors and service users. We do this
        by:</p>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Undertaking an access audit to establish if the setting is accessible to all disabled children and adults.
          If access to the setting is found to treat disabled children or adults less favourably, then we make
          reasonable adjustments to accommodate the needs of disabled children and adults.</li>
        <li>Fully differentiating the environment, resources and curriculum to accommodate a wide range of learning,
          physical and sensory needs.</li>

      </div>

      <h2>Whistle-blowing policy</h2>

      <h3>Policy statement</h3>
      <p>Whistle blowing encourages and enables employees to raise serious concerns that they may have with the
        organisation.</p>

      <div class="officer-info">
        <p><strong>Our whistle blowing officer is – Sophie Richman / Zeba Wafa</strong></p>
      </div>

      <h3>Aims</h3>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>We will share this policy with all who use this setting including all employees' students and volunteers.
        </li>
        <li>We give staff reassurance and confidence to be able to raise a concern.</li>
        <li>We will investigate and deal with concerns as a matter of urgency, give you feedback and make you aware of
          how to pursue if you are unsatisfied.</li>
        <li>Reassure you that you will be protected and that all concerns are kept confidential and that your employment
          rights upheld.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This policy is based on safeguarding children.</p>

      <h3>Blowing the whistle on malpractice is as follows</h3>
      <ul class="malpractice-list">
        <li>Fraud or corruption</li>
        <li>Unauthorised use of nursery goods</li>
        <li>The neglect, physical, emotional or sexual of employees or children</li>

        <li>Involved in act of radicalisation or extremism</li>
        <li>Other unethical conduct</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is a whistle blowing policy?</h3>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Whistle blowing occurs when a worker raises a concern about danger or illegality that affects others for
          example members of the public or harm towards children.</li>
        <li>Employees are often the first to realise that there may be something seriously wrong within the nursery.
          However, they may not express their concerns because they feel that speaking up would be disloyal to their
          colleague or to the nursery. They may also fear harassment or victimisation. In these circumstances it may be
          easier to ignore the concerns rather than report what may just be a suspicion of malpractice.</li>
        <li>We are committed to the highest possible standards of openness, probity and accountability in line with
          commitment we expect employees and others that we deal with who have serious concerns. It is recognised that
          most cases will have to proceed on a confidential basis.</li>
        <li>Staff can whistleblow on other member staff if they see practices which causes concerns and putting children
          and the business at risk. If they are concerned about a member of staff they can raise this with the Director
          or an Area Manager.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Head fire marshal to liaise with fire service on arrival</li>
        <li>No person shall re-enter the building until officially instructed</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Variations</h2>
      <p>There are currently no identified instances where alternative measures are required.</p>

      <p>A separate fire evacuation procedure will be needed in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ol class="procedures-list">
        <li>Special events</li>
        <li>Out of hours work</li>
        <li>Lone work</li>
        <li>Construction work</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Means of Escape</h2>
      <p>Escape routes (corridors, stairways, walkways etc) and exits are shown on the fire plan(s). All escape routes
        are kept free from:</p>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Potential sources of ignition</li>
        <li>Combustible materials</li>
        <li>Obstructions and trip hazards</li>
        <li>The holding open of designated fire doors</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All escape routes are adequately lit when the premises is in use. The emergency lighting system utilises
        self-contained battery operated lights, trickle charged from the main electrical supply, coming into operation
        on the failure of the local mains lighting. The batteries have sufficient capacity to operate the lights for at
        least one hour.</p>

      <h2>Fire Drills</h2>
      <p>Fire drills are carried out at least twice annually and reflect normal working conditions. Scenarios such as
        the loss of a fire exit due to fire will be included and at least one fire drill per year will be unannounced.
        Everyone will be fully included with fire drills, including any visitors or contractors present.</p>

      <p>After each fire drill, performance will be reviewed to assess the evacuation procedure and highlight areas for
        improvement. Reviews will assess:</p>
      <ol class="procedures-list">
        <li>Effectiveness of evacuation procedure</li>
        <li>Staff knowledge of evacuation procedure</li>
        <li>Responsibilities</li>
        <li>Performance of fire marshals</li>
        <li>Evacuation times</li>

      <h2>Variations</h2>
      <p>There are currently no identified instances where alternative measures are required.</p>

      <p>A separate fire evacuation procedure will be needed in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ol class="procedures-list">
        <li>Special events</li>
        <li>Out of hours work</li>
        <li>Lone work</li>
        <li>Construction work</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Means of Escape</h2>
      <p>Escape routes (corridors, stairways, walkways etc) and exits are shown on the fire plan(s). All escape routes
        are kept free from:</p>
      <ul class="procedures-list">
        <li>Potential sources of ignition</li>
        <li>Combustible materials</li>
        <li>Obstructions and trip hazards</li>
        <li>The holding open of designated fire doors</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All escape routes are adequately lit when the premises is in use. The emergency lighting system utilises
        self-contained battery operated lights, trickle charged from the main electrical supply, coming into operation
        on the failure of the local mains lighting. The batteries have sufficient capacity to operate the lights for at
        least one hour.</p>

      <h2>Fire Drills</h2>
      <p>Fire drills are carried out at least twice annually and reflect normal working conditions. Scenarios such as
        the loss of a fire exit due to fire will be included and at least one fire drill per year will be unannounced.
        Everyone will be fully included with fire drills, including any visitors or contractors present.</p>

      <p>After each fire drill, performance will be reviewed to assess the evacuation procedure and highlight areas for
        improvement. Reviews will assess:</p>
      <ol class="procedures-list">
        <li>Effectiveness of evacuation procedure</li>
        <li>Staff knowledge of evacuation procedure</li>
        <li>Responsibilities</li>
        <li>Performance of fire marshals</li>
        <li>Evacuation times</li>
      </ol>
