        Adopted: 23/08/2025 | To be reviewed: 22/08/2025
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>While it is not our policy to care for sick children, who should be at home until they are well enough to return to the setting, we will agree to administer medication as part of maintaining their health and well-being or when they are recovering from an illness. We ensure that where medicines are necessary to maintain health of the child, they are given correctly and in accordance with legal requirements.</p>

        <p>In many cases, it is possible for children's GPs to prescribe medicine that can be taken at home in the morning and evening. As far as possible, administering medicines will only be done where it would be detrimental to the child's health if not given in the setting. If a child has not had a medication before, especially a baby/child under two, it is advised that the parent keeps the child at home for the first 48 hours to ensure there are no adverse effects, as well as to give time for the medication to take effect.</p>

        <p>Our staff are responsible for the correct administration of medication to children for whom they are the key person responsible for the correct administration of medication to children who attend my setting]. This includes ensuring that parent consent forms have been completed, that medicines are stored correctly and that records are kept according to procedures. In the absence of the key person, the manager is responsible for the overseeing of administering medication. I notify our insurance provider of all required conditions, as laid out in our insurance policy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Children taking prescribed medication must be well enough to attend the setting.</li>
          <li>We only usually administer medication when it has been prescribed for a child by a doctor (or other medically qualified person). It must be in-date and prescribed for the current condition.</li>
          <li>Non-prescription medication, such as pain or fever relief (e.g. Calpol) and teething gel, anti-histamine or inhalers may be administered, but only with prior written consent of the parent and only when there is a health reason to do so, such as a high temperature. Children under the age of 16 years are never given medicines containing aspirin unless prescribed specifically for that child by a doctor. The administering of un-prescribed medication is recorded in the same way as any other medication. NB We may administer children's paracetamol (un-prescribed) for children under the age of one year with the verbal consent of the parents in the case of a high temperature. This is to prevent febrile convulsion and where a parent or named person is on their way to collect the child.</li>
          <li>Children's prescribed medicines are stored in their original containers, are clearly labelled and are inaccessible to the children. On receiving the medication, the member of staff checks that it is in date and prescribed specifically for the current condition.</li>
          <li>Parents must give prior written permission for the administration of medication. The staff member receiving the medication will ask the parent to sign a consent form stating the following information. No medication may be given without these details being provided:
            <ul>
              <li>the full name of child and date of birth</li>
              <li>the name of medication and strength</li>
              <li>who prescribed it</li>
              <li>the dosage and times to be given in the setting</li>
              <li>the method of administration</li>
              <li>how the medication should be stored and its expiry date</li>
              <li>any possible side effects that may be expected</li>
              <li>the signature of the parent, their printed name and the date</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The administration of medicine is recorded accurately in our medication record book each time it is given and is signed by the person administering the medication and a witness. Parents are shown the record at the end of the day and asked to sign the record book to acknowledge the administration of the medicine. The medication record book records the:
            <ul>
              <li>name of the child</li>
              <li>name and strength of the medication</li>
              <li>name of the doctor that prescribed it</li>
              <li>date and time of the dose</li>
              <li>dose given and method</li>
              <li>signature of the person administering the medication and a witness who verifies that the medication has been given correctly</li>
              <li>parent's signature (at the end of the day).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We use the Pre-school Learning Alliance Medication Administration Record book for recording the administration of medicine and comply with the detailed procedures set out in that publication.</li>
          <li>If the administration of prescribed medication requires medical knowledge, we obtain individual training for the relevant member of staff by a health professional.</li>
          <li>If rectal diazepam is given, another member of staff must be present and co-signs the record book.</li>
          <li>No child may self-administer. Where children are capable of understanding when they need medication, for example with asthma, they should be encouraged to tell their key person what they need. However, this does not replace staff vigilance in knowing and responding when a child requires medication.</li>
          <li>We monitor the medication record book is monitored to look at the frequency of medication given in the setting. For example, a high incidence of antibiotics being prescribed for a number of children at similar times may indicate a need for better infection control.</li>
          <li>Any medication that has not been given to children before, must be administered by parents at home and monitored at home for 48 hours before child is allowed back in the setting.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Storage of medicines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All medication is stored safely in a locked cupboard or refrigerated as required. Where the cupboard or refrigerator is not used solely for storing medicines, they are kept in a marked plastic box.</li>
          <li>The child's key person is responsible for ensuring medicine is handed back at the end of the day to the parent.</li>
          <li>All medicine must be administered by a qualified level 3 member of staff with paediatric first aid training.</li>
          <li>For some conditions, medication may be kept in the setting to be administered on a regular or as-and-when-required basis. Key persons check that any medication held in the setting, is in date and return any out-of-date medication back to the parent.</li>
          <li>Insert details here of how and where medicines are stored in your setting. State how staff, childminders or assistants are informed of this.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Children who have long term medical conditions and who may require ongoing medication</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We carry out a risk assessment for each child with a long term medical condition that requires on-going medication. This is the responsibility of our manager alongside the key person. Other medical or social care personnel may need to be involved in the risk assessment.</li>
          <li>Parents will also contribute to a risk assessment. They should be shown around the setting, understand the routines and activities and point out anything which they think may be a risk factor for their child.</li>
          <li>For some medical conditions, key staff will need to have training in a basic understanding of the condition, as well as how the medication is to be administered correctly. The training needs for staff form part of the risk assessment.</li>
          <li>The risk assessment includes vigorous activities and any other activity that may give cause for concern regarding an individual child's health needs.</li>
          <li>The risk assessment includes arrangements for taking medicines on outings and advice is sought from the child's GP if necessary where there are concerns.</li>
          <li>An individual health plan for the child is drawn up with the parent; outlining the key person's role and what information must be shared with other adults who care for the child.</li>
          <li>The individual health plan should include the measures to be taken in an emergency.</li>
          <li>We review the individual health plan every six months, or more frequently if necessary. This includes reviewing the medication, e.g. changes to the medication or the dosage, any side effects noted etc.</li>
          <li>Parents receive a copy of the individual health plan and each contributor, including the parent, signs it.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Managing medicines on trips and outings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If children are going on outings, the key person for the child will accompany the children with a risk assessment, or another member of staff/childminder who is fully informed about the child's needs and/or medication.</li>
          <li>Medication for a child is taken in a sealed plastic box clearly labelled with the child's name, the original pharmacist's label and the name of the medication. Inside the box is a copy of the consent form and a card to record when it has been given, including all the details that need to be recorded in the medication record as stated above. For medication dispensed by a hospital pharmacy, where the child's details are not on the dispensing label, we will record the circumstances of the event and hospital instructions as relayed by the parents.</li>
          <li>On returning to the setting the card is stapled to the medicine record book and the parent signs it.</li>
          <li>If a child on medication has to be taken to hospital, the child's medication is taken in a sealed plastic box clearly labelled with the child's name and the name of the medication. Inside the box is a copy of the consent form signed by the parent.</li>
          <li>This procedure should be read alongside the outings procedure.</li>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We have record keeping systems in place that meet legal requirements; the means we use to store and share that information take place within the framework of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) (2018) and the Human Rights Act (1998).</p>

        <p>This policy and procedure should be read alongside our Privacy Notice, Confidentiality and Client Access to Records Policy and our Information Sharing Policy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <p>If a child attends another setting, we establish a regular two-way flow of appropriate information with parents and other providers. Where appropriate, we will incorporate comments from other providers, as well as parents and/or carers into the child's records.</p>

        <p><strong>We keep two kinds of records of children attending our setting:</strong></p>

        <h3>Developmental records</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>These include observations of children in the setting, photographs, video clips and samples of their work and summary developmental reports.</li>
          <li>These are usually kept in our Blossom Management software system and some hard copies are kept in a file in a filing cabinet and can be accessed, and contributed to, by our staff, the child and the child's parents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Personal records</h3>
        <p>These may include the following (as applicable):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal details</strong> – including the child's registration form and any consent forms.</li>
          <li><strong>Contractual matters</strong> – including a copy of the signed parent contract, the child's days and times of attendance, a record of the child's fees, any fee reminders or records of disputes about fees.</li>
          <li><strong>Child's development, health and well-being</strong> – including a summary only of the child's EYFS profile report, a record of discussions about every day matters about the child's development health and well-bring with the parent.</li>
          <li><strong>Early Support</strong> – including any additional focussed intervention provided by [our/my] setting (e.g. support for behaviour, language or development that needs an SEN action plan) and records of any meetings held.</li>
          <li><strong>Welfare and child protection concerns</strong> – including records of all welfare and protection concerns, and [our/my] resulting action, meetings and telephone conversations about the child, an Education, Health and Care Plan and any information regarding a Looked After Child.</li>
          <li><strong>Correspondence and Reports</strong> – including a copy of the child's 2 Year Old Progress Check (as applicable), all letters and emails to and from other agencies and any confidential reports from other agencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These confidential records are stored in a lockable file or cabinet, which is always locked when not in use and which our manager keeps secure in an office or other suitably safe place.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We read any correspondence in relation to a child, note any actions and file it immediately</li>
          <li>We ensure that access to children's files is restricted to those authorised to see them and make entries in them, this being [our manager, deputy or designated person for child protection, the child's key person, or other staff as authorised by our manager and other staff as authorised by me.</li>
          <li>We may be required to hand children's personal files to Ofsted as part of an inspection or investigation process; or to local authority staff conducting an S11 audit, as long as authorisation is seen. We ensure that children's personal files are not handed over to anyone else to look at.</li>
          <li>Parents have access, in accordance with our Privacy Notice, Confidentiality and Client Access to Records Policy, to the files and records of their own children, but do not have access to information about any other child.</li>
          <li>Our staff will not discuss personal information given by parents with other members of staff, except where it affects planning for the child's needs. Our staff induction programme includes an awareness of the importance of confidentiality in the role of the key person.</li>
          <li>We retain children's records for three years after they have left the setting; except records that relate to an accident or child protection matter, which are kept until a child reaches the age of 21 years or 24 years respectively. These are kept in a secure place.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Archiving children's files</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When a child leaves our setting, we remove all paper documents from the child's personal file and place them in a locked cupboard. We seal this and place it in an archive box, stored in a safe place (i.e. a locked cabinet) for three years. After three years it is destroyed.</li>
          <li>If data is kept electronically it is encrypted and stored as above.</li>
          <li>Where there were s.47 child protection investigations, we mark the envelope with a star and archived it for 7 years. We keep all children's files for 7 years before destroying them safely.</li>
          <li>We store financial information according to our finance procedures.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Other Records</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We keep a daily record of the names of the children we are caring for, their hours of attendance and the names of their key person.</li>
          <li>Students on Early Years Alliance or other recognised qualifications and training, when they are observing in the setting, are advised of our Confidentiality and Client Access to Records Policy and are required to respect it.</li>

        <p><em>'Share with informed consent where appropriate and, where possible, respect the wishes of those who do not consent to share confidential information. You may still share information without consent if, in your judgement, there is good reason to do so, such as where safety may be at risk.

        <p>In our setting, staff and managers can be said to have a 'confidential relationship' with families. It is our intention to respect the privacy of children and their parents and carers, while ensuring that they access high quality early years care and education in our setting. We aim to ensure that all parents and carers can share their information in the confidence that it will only be used to enhance the welfare of their children. We have record keeping systems in place that meet legal requirements; the means that we use to store and share that information takes place within the framework of the General Data Protection Regulations (2018) and the Human Rights Act (1998).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Confidentiality procedures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Most things that happen between the family, the child and the setting are confidential to our setting. In exceptional circumstances information is shared, for example with other professionals or possibly social care or the police.</li>
          <li>Information shared with other agencies is done in line with our Information Sharing Policy.</li>
          <li>We always check whether parents regard the information they share with us to be confidential or not.</li>
          <li>Some parents may share information about themselves with other parents as well as with our staff; we cannot be held responsible if information is shared by those parents whom the person has 'confided' in.</li>
          <li>Information shared between parents in a discussion or training group is usually bound by a shared agreement that the information is confidential to the group and not discussed outside of it. We are not responsible should that confidentiality be breached by participants.</li>
          <li>We inform parents when we need to record confidential information beyond the general personal information we keep (see our Children's Records Policy and Privacy Notice) - for example with regard to any injuries, concerns or changes in relation to the child or the family, any discussions with parents on sensitive matters, any records we are obliged to keep regarding action taken in respect of child protection and any contact and correspondence with external agencies in relation to their child.</li>
          <li>We keep all records securely (see our Children's Records Policy and Privacy Notice).</li>
          <li>Information is kept in a manual file, or electronically. Our staff may also use a computer to type reports, or letters. Where this is the case, the typed document is deleted from the PC and only the hard copy kept.</li>
          <li>Where it is helpful to keep an electronic copy nobody has access to the main PC.</li>
          <li>Our staff discuss children's general progress and well being together in meetings, but more sensitive information is restricted to our manager and the child's key person, and is shared with other staff on a need to know basis.</li>
          <li>We do not discuss children with [staff who are not involved in the child's care, nor with] other parents or anyone else outside of the setting.</li>
          <li>Our discussions with other professionals take place within a professional framework and not on an informal or ad-hoc basis.</li>
          <li>Where third parties share information about an individual us; our practitioners and managers check if it is confidential, both in terms of the party sharing the information and of the person whom the information concerns.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Client access to records procedures</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Parents may request access to any confidential records we hold on their child and family following the procedure below:</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>The parent is the 'subject' of the file in the case where a child is too young to give 'informed consent' and has a right to see information that our setting has compiled on them.</li>
          <li>Any request to see the child's personal file by a parent or person with parental responsibility must be made in writing to the setting leader or manager.</li>
          <li>We acknowledge the request in writing, informing the parent that an arrangement will be made for him/her to see the file contents, subject to third party consent.</li>
          <li>Our written acknowledgement allows one month for the file to be made ready and available. We will be able to extend this by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous. If this is the case, We will inform you within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary</li>
          <li>A fee may be charged for repeated requests, or where a request requires excessive administration to fulfil.</li>
          <li>Our manager informs their line manager and legal advice may be sought before sharing a file may seek legal advice before sharing a file.</li>
          <li>Our manager goes through the file with their line manager and ensures go through the file and ensure that all documents have been filed correctly, that entries are in date order and that there are no missing pages. They note any information, entry or correspondence or other document which mentions a third party.</li>
          <li>We write to each of those individuals explaining that the subject has requested sight of the file, which contains a reference to them, stating what this is.</li>
          <li>They are asked to reply in writing to our manager giving or refusing consent for disclosure of that material.</li>
          <li>We keep copies of these letters and their replies on the child's file.</li>
          <li>'Third parties' include each family member noted on the file; so where there are separate entries pertaining to each parent, step parent, grandparent etc. we write to each of them to request third party consent.</li>
          <li>Third parties also include workers from any other agency, including children's social care and the health authority for example. Agencies will normally refuse consent to share information, preferring instead for the parent to be redirected to those agencies for a request to see their file held by that agency.</li>
          <li>Members of our staff should also be written to, but we reserve the right under the legislation to override a refusal for consent or to just delete the name of the staff member and not the information. We may grant refusal if the member of staff has provided information that could be considered 'sensitive' and the staff member may be in danger if that information is disclosed; or if that information is the basis of a police investigation. However, if the information is not sensitive, then it is not in our interest to withhold that information from a parent. In each case this should be discussed with members of staff and decisions recorded.</li>
          <li>When we have received all the consents/refusals our manager takes a photocopy of the complete file. On the copy of the file, our manager removes any information that a third party has refused consent for us to disclose and blank out any references to the third party, and any information they have added to the file, using a thick marker pen.</li>
          <li>The copy file is then checked by the line manager and legal advisors to verify that the file has been prepared appropriately.</li>
          <li>What remains is the information recorded by the setting, detailing the work initiated and followed by them in relation to confidential matters. This is called the 'clean copy'.</li>
          <li>We photocopy the 'clean copy' again and collate it for the parent to see.</li>
          <li>Our manager informs the parent that the file is now ready and invite[s] him/her to make an appointment to view it.</li>
          <li>Our manager and their line manager meet with the parent to go through the file, explaining the process as well as what the content of the file records about the child and the work that has been done. Only the person(s) with parental responsibility can attend that meeting, or the parent's legal representative or interpreter.</li>
          <li>The parent may take a copy of the prepared file away; but, to ensure it is properly explained to and understood by the parent, we never hand it over without discussion.</li>
          <li>It is an offence to remove material that is controversial or to rewrite records to make them more acceptable. Our recording procedures and guidelines ensure that the material reflects an accurate and non-judgemental account of the work we have done with the family.</li>
          <li>If a parent feels aggrieved about any entry in the file, or the resulting outcome, then we refer the parent to our complaints procedure.</li>
          <li>The law requires that the information we hold must be held for a legitimate reason and must be accurate (see our Privacy Notice). If a parent says that the information we hold is inaccurate, then the parent has a right to request for it to be changed. However, this only pertains to factual inaccuracies. Where the disputed entry is a matter of opinion, professional judgement, or represents a different view of the matter than that held by the parent, we retain the right not to change that entry, but we can record the parent's view of the matter. In most cases, we would have given a parent the opportunity at the time to state their side of the matter, and it would have been recorded there and then.</li>
          <li>If there are any controversial aspects of the content of a child's file, we must seek legal advice. This might be where there is a court case between parents, where social care or the police may be considering legal action, or where a case has already completed and an appeal process is underway.</li>
          <li>We never 'under-record' for fear of the parent seeing, nor do we make 'personal notes' elsewhere.</li>

          <li>We work towards offering equality of opportunity by using non-discriminatory procedures for staff recruitment and selection.</li>
          <li>All our staff have job descriptions, which set out their roles and responsibilities.</li>

          <li>We follow the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage and Ofsted guidance on checking the suitability of all staff and volunteers who will have unsupervised access to children. This includes obtaining references and ensuring they have a satisfactory enhanced criminal records check with barred list(s) check through the DBS. This is in accordance with requirements under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act (2006) and the Protection of Freedoms Act (2012) for the vetting and barring scheme.</li>
          <li>Where an individual is subscribed to the DBS Update Service we carry out a status check of their DBS certificate, after checking their identity and viewing their original enhanced DBS certificate to ensure that it does not reveal any information that would affect their suitability for the post. We obtain this before their start of employment.</li>
          <li>We keep all records relating to the employment of our staff and volunteers; in particular those demonstrating that suitability checks have been done, including the date of issue, name, and type of DBS</li>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We ensure the highest possible standard of fire precautions is in place. The person in charge and our staff are familiar with the current legal requirements. Where necessary we seek the advice of a competent person, such as our Fire Officer or Fire Safety Consultant. A Fire Safety Log Book is used to record the findings of risk assessment, any actions taken or incidents that have occurred and our fire drills. Downloadable Fire Safety Log Books are widely available free of charge on line. We ensure our policy is in line with the procedures specific to our building, making reasonable adjustments as required.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <h3>Fire safety risk assessment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The basis of fire safety is risk assessment, carried out by a 'competent person'.</li>
          <li>The manager has received training in fire safety sufficient to be competent to carry out the risk assessment; this will be written where there are more than five staff and will follow the Government guidance Fire Safety Risk Assessment - Educational Premises (HMG 2006).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Our fire safety risk assessment focuses on the following for each area of the setting:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Electrical plugs, wires</li>
          <li>Electrical items.</li>
          <li>Gas boilers.</li>
          <li>Cookers.</li>
          <li>Matches.</li>
          <li>Candles</li>
          <li>Flammable materials – including furniture, furnishings, paper etc.</li>
          <li>Flammable chemicals.</li>
          <li>Means of escape.</li>
          <li>Anything else identified.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Where we rent premises, we will ensure that we have a copy of the fire safety risk assessment that applies to the building and that we contribute to regular reviews.</p>

        <h3>Fire safety precautions taken</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We ensure that fire doors are clearly marked, never obstructed and easily opened from the inside.</li>
          <li>We ensure that smoke detectors/alarms and fire fighting appliances conform to BS EN standards, are fitted in appropriate high risk areas of the building and are checked as specified by the manufacturer.</li>
          <li>We have all electrical equipment checked annually by a registered PAT person. Any faulty electrical equipment is taken out of use and either repaired or replaced.</li>
          <li>Our emergency evacuation procedures are approved by the Fire Safety Officer and are:
            <ul>
              <li>clearly displayed on the premises;</li>
              <li>explained to new members of staff volunteers and parents; and</li>
              <li>practised regularly, at least once every six weeks.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Records are kept of fire drills and of the servicing of fire safety equipment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Emergency evacuation procedure</h3>
        <p>Every setting is different and the evacuation procedure will be suitable for each setting. It must cover procedures for practice drills including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How children are familiar with the sound of the fire alarm.</li>
          <li>How the children, staff and parents know where the fire exits are.</li>
          <li>How children are led from the building to the assembly point.</li>
          <li>How children will be accounted for and who by.</li>
          <li>How long does it take to get the children out safely?</li>
          <li>Who calls the emergency services, and when, in the event of a real fire.</li>
          <li>How parents are contacted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fire drills</h3>
        <p>We hold fire drills termly or as when a new member staff joins our setting and record the following information about each fire drill in the Fire Safety Log Book:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The date and time of the drill.</li>
          <li>Number of adults and children involved.</li>
          <li>How long it takes to evacuate.</li>
          <li>Whether there were any problems that delayed evacuation.</li>
          <li>Any further action taken to improve the drill procedure.</li>

        <h2>Variations</h2>
        <p>There are currently no identified instances where alternative measures are required.</p>
        <p>A separate fire evacuation procedure will be needed in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Special events</li>
          <li>Out of hours work</li>
          <li>Lone work</li>
          <li>Construction work</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Means of Escape</h2>
        <p>Escape routes (corridors, stairways, walkways etc) and exits are shown on the fire plan(s). All escape routes are kept free from:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Potential sources of ignition</li>
          <li>Combustible materials</li>
          <li>Obstructions and trip hazards</li>
          <li>The holding open of designated fire doors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All escape routes are adequately lit when the premises is in use. The emergency lighting system utilises self-contained battery operated lights, trickle charged from the main electrical supply, coming into operation on the failure of the local mains lighting. The batteries have sufficient capacity to operate the lights for at least one hour.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Fire Drills</h2>
        <p>Fire drills are carried out at least twice annually and reflect normal working conditions. Scenarios such as the loss of a fire exit due to fire will be included and at least one fire drill per year will be unannounced. Everyone will be fully included with fire drills, including any visitors or contractors present.</p>

        <p>After each fire drill, performance will be reviewed to assess the evacuation procedure and highlight areas for improvement.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Reviews will assess:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Effectiveness of evacuation procedure</li>
          <li>Staff knowledge of evacuation procedure</li>
          <li>Responsibilities</li>
          <li>Performance of fire marshals</li>
          <li>Evacuation times</li>

        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We regard snack and meal times as an important part of our day. Eating represents a social time for children and adults, and helps children to learn about healthy eating. At snack and meal times, we aim to provide nutritious food, which meets the children's individual dietary needs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <p>We follow these procedures to promote healthy eating in [our/my] setting.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Before a child starts to attend the setting, we ask their parents about their dietary needs and preferences, including any allergies. (See the Managing Children who are Sick, Infectious or with Allergies Policy.)</li>
          <li>We record information about each child's dietary needs in the Registration Form and parents sign the form to signify that it is correct.</li>

          <li>We display current information about individual children's dietary needs so that all our staff and volunteers are fully informed about them.</li>
          <li>We implement systems to ensure that children receive only food and drink that is consistent with their dietary needs and preferences, as well as their parents' wishes.</li>
          <li>We plan menus in line with EYFS Nutritious Mela guidelines.(2025)</li>
          <li>We display the menus of meals/snacks for parents to view including allergens.</li>
          <li>We provide nutritious food for all meals and snacks, avoiding large quantities of saturated fat, sugar and salt and artificial additives, preservatives and colourings.</li>
          <li>We include a variety of foods from the four main food groups:
            <ul>
              <li>meat, fish and protein alternatives</li>
              <li>dairy foods</li>
              <li>grains, cereals and starch vegetables</li>
              <li>fruit and vegetables</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We include foods from the diet of each of the children's cultural backgrounds, providing children with familiar foods and introducing them to new ones.</li>
          <li>We take care not to provide food containing nuts or nut products and we are especially vigilant where we have a child who has a known allergy to nuts.</li>
          <li>Through discussion with parents and research reading, we obtain information about the dietary rules of the religious groups to which children and their parents belong, and of vegetarians and vegans, as well as about food allergies. We take account of this information in the provision of food and drinks.</li>
          <li>We provide a vegetarian alternative on days when meat or fish are offered and make every effort to ensure Halal meat is available for children who require it.</li>
          <li>We show sensitivity in providing for children's diets and allergies. We do not use a child's diet or allergy as a label for the child, or make a child feel singled out because of her/his diet or allergy.</li>
          <li>We organise meal and snack times so that they are social occasions in which children and adults participate.</li>
          <li>We use meal and snack times to help children to develop independence through making choices, serving food and drink and feeding themselves.</li>
          <li>We provide children with utensils that are appropriate for their ages and stages of development and that take account of the eating practices in their cultures.</li>
          <li>We have fresh drinking water constantly available for the children. We inform the children about how to obtain the water and that they can ask for water at any time during the day.</li>
          <li>In accordance with parents' wishes, we offer children arriving early in the morning, and/or staying late, an appropriate meal or snack.</li>
          <li>We inform parents who provide food for their children about the storage facilities available in our setting.</li>
          <li>We give parents who provide food for their children information about suitable containers for food.</li>

          <li>For young children who drink milk, we provide whole pasteurised milk. Although we slowly introduce semi-skimmed milk from the age of two years; firstly into meals and dishes, such as on cereal or in white sauces, before offering it as a drink, so that the transition is gradual.</li>
          <li>For each child under two, we provide parents with daily written information about feeding routines, intake and preferences.</li>
          <li>We serve small portions of food to the children and give them second helping if they ask. We do not overfeed the children.</li>

      <h1>1.3 Looked after children</h1>

      <div class="header-info">
        <strong>Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd</strong><br>
        Adopted: 07/09/2025 | To be reviewed: 06/09/2026
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We are committed to providing quality provision based on equality of opportunity for all children and their families. All staff in our provision are committed to doing all they can to enable 'looked after' children in our care to achieve and reach their full potential.</p>

        <p>Children become 'looked after' if they have either been taken into care by the local authority, or have been accommodated by the local authority (a voluntary care arrangement). Most looked after children will be living in foster homes, but a smaller number may be in a children's home, living with a relative or even placed back home with their natural parent(s).</p>

        <p>We recognise that children who are being looked after have often experienced traumatic situations; physical, emotional or sexual abuse or neglect. However, we also recognise that not all looked after children have experienced abuse and that there are a range of reasons for children to be taken in to the care of the local authority. Whatever the reason, a child's separation from their home and family signifies a disruption in their lives that has an impact on their emotional well-being. Most local authorities do not place children under five with foster carers who work outside the home; however, there are instances when this does occur or where the child has been placed with another family member who works. It is not appropriate for a looked after child who is under two years to be placed in a day care setting in addition to a foster placement.</p>

        <p>We place emphasis on promoting children's right to be strong, resilient and listened to. Our policy and practice guidelines for looked after children are based on two important concepts: attachment and resilience. The basis of this is to promote secure attachments in children's lives, as the foundation for resilience. These aspects of well-being underpin the child's responsiveness to learning and enable the development of positive dispositions for learning. For young children to get the most out of educational opportunities they need to be settled enough with their carer to be able to cope with further separation, a new environment and new expectations made upon them.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Principles</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The term 'looked after child' denotes a child's current legal status; this term is never used to categorise a child as standing out from others. We do not refer to such a child using acronyms such as LAC.</li>
          <li>We do not normally offer placements for babies and children under two years who are in care; we offer instead other services to enable a child to play and engage with other children while their carer stays with them.</li>
          <li>In exceptional circumstances, we offer places to two-year-old children who are in care. In such cases, the child should have been with the foster carer for at least two months and show signs of having formed a secure attachment to the carer, and the placement in the setting will last a minimum of three months.</li>
          <li>We offer places for funded three and four-year-olds who are in care to ensure they receive their entitlement to early education. We expect that a child will have been with a foster carer for a minimum of one month and that they will have formed a secure attachment to the carer. We expect that the placement in the setting will last a minimum of six weeks.</li>
          <li>We will always offer 'stay and play' provision for a child who is two to five years old who is still settling with their foster carer, or who is only temporarily being looked after.</li>
          <li>Where a child who normally attends our setting is taken into care and is cared for by a local foster carer, we will continue to offer the placement for the child.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>The designated person for looked after children is the designated child protection co-ordinator.</li>
          <li>Every child is allocated a key person before they start and this is no different for a looked after child. The designated person ensures the key person has the information, support and training necessary to meet the looked after child's needs.</li>
          <li>The designated person and the key person liaise with agencies, professionals and practitioners involved with the child and his or her family and ensure that appropriate information is gained and shared.</li>
          <li>The setting recognises the role of the local authority children's social care department as the child's 'corporate parent' and the key agency in determining what takes place with the child. Nothing changes, especially with regard to the birth parent's or foster carer's role in relation to the setting, without prior discussion and agreement with the child's social worker.</li>
          <li>At the start of a placement there is a professional's meeting to determine the objectives of the placement and draw up a care plan that incorporates the child's learning needs. This plan is reviewed after two weeks, six weeks and three months. Thereafter at three to six monthly intervals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">The care plan needs to consider issues for the child such as:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>their emotional needs and how they are to be met;</li>
          <li>how any emotional issues and problems that affect behaviour are to be managed;</li>
          <li>their sense of self, culture, language(s) and identity – and how this is to be supported;</li>
          <li>their need for sociability and friendship;</li>
          <li>their interests and abilities and possible learning journey pathway; and</li>
          <li>how any special needs will be supported.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">In addition the care plan will also consider:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>how information will be shared with the foster carer and local authority (as the 'corporate parent') as well as what information is shared with whom and how it will be recorded and stored;</li>
          <li>what contact the child has with his/her birth parent(s) and what arrangements will be in place for supervised contact. If this is to be at the setting, when, where and what form the contact will take will be discussed and agreed;</li>
          <li>what written reporting is required;</li>
          <li>wherever possible, and where the plan is for the child to return home, the birth parent(s) should be involved in planning; and</li>
          <li>with the social worker's agreement, and as part of the plan, the birth parent(s) should be involved in the setting's activities that include parents, such as outings and fun-days etc alongside the foster carer.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul style="margin-top: 30px;">
          <li>The settling-in process for the child is agreed. It should be the same as for any other child, with the foster carer taking the place of the parent, unless otherwise agreed. It is even more important that the 'proximity' stage is followed until it is visible that the child has formed a sufficient relationship with his or her key person for them to act as a 'secure base' to allow the gradual separation from the foster carer. This process may take longer in some cases, so time needs to be allowed for it to take place without causing further distress or anxiety to the child.</li>
          <li>In the first two weeks after settling-in, the child's well-being is the focus of observation, their sociability and their ability to manage their feelings with or without support.</li>
          <li>Further observations about communication, interests and abilities will be noted to firm a picture of the whole child in relation to the Early Years Foundation Stage prime and specific areas of learning and development.</li>
          <li>Concerns about the child will be noted in the child's file and discussed with the foster carer.</li>
          <li>If the concerns are about the foster carer's treatment of the child, or if abuse is suspected, these are recorded in the child's file and reported to the child's social worker according to the setting's safeguarding children procedure.</li>
          <li>Regular contact should be maintained with the social worker through planned meetings that will include the foster carer.</li>
          <li>The transition to school will be handled sensitively. The designated person and/or the child's key person will liaise with the school, passing on relevant information and documentation with the agreement of the child's social worker as detailed in the care plan.</li>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We aim to provide care for healthy children through preventing cross infection of viruses and bacterial infections and promote health through identifying allergies and preventing contact with the allergenic trigger.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures for children who are sick or infectious</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>If children appear unwell during the day – for example, if they have a temperature, sickness, diarrhoea or pains, particularly in the head or stomach – our manager call the parents and ask them to collect the child, or to send a known carer to collect the child on their behalf.</li>
          <li>If a child has a temperature, they are kept cool, by removing top clothing and sponging their heads with cool water, but kept away from draughts.</li>
          <li>The child's temperature is taken using a forehead thermometer strip, kept in the first aid box.</li>
          <li>If the child's temperature does not go down and is worryingly high, then we may give them Calpol or another similar analgesic, after first obtaining verbal consent from the parent where possible. This is to reduce the risk of febrile convulsions, particularly for babies. Parents sign the medication record when they collect their child.</li>
          <li>In extreme cases of emergency, an ambulance is called and the parent informed.</li>
          <li>Parents are asked to take their child to the doctor before returning them to the setting; we can refuse admittance to children who have a temperature, sickness and diarrhoea or a contagious infection or disease.</li>
          <li>Where children have been prescribed antibiotics for an infectious illness or complaint, we ask parents to keep them at home for 48 hours before returning to the setting.</li>
          <li>Where children have a temperature of 38c, or above, they will be asked to stay at home for 24 hours, since the last recorded temperature.</li>
          <li>After diarrhoea, we ask parents keep children home for 48 hours following the last episode.</li>
          <li>Some activities, such as sand and water play, and self-serve snacks where there is a risk of cross-contamination may be suspended for the duration of any outbreak.</li>
          <li>We a list of excludable diseases and current exclusion times. The full list is obtainable from www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-in-schools-and-other-childcare-facilities and includes common childhood illnesses such as measles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Reporting of 'notifiable diseases'</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If a child or adult is diagnosed as suffering from a notifiable disease under the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010, the GP will report this to Public Health England.</li>
          <li>When we become aware, or are formally informed of the notifiable disease, [our manager informs/I inform] Ofsted and contacts Public Health England, and act[s] on any advice given.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">HIV/AIDS/Hepatitis procedure</h3>
        <p>HIV virus, like other viruses such as Hepatitis A, B and C, are spread through body fluids. Hygiene precautions for dealing with body fluids are the same for all children and adults. [We/I]:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wear single-use vinyl gloves and aprons when changing children's nappies, pants and clothing that are soiled with blood, urine, faeces or vomit.</li>
          <li>Bag soiled clothing for parents to take home for cleaning.</li>
          <li>Clear spills of blood, urine, faeces or vomit using mild disinfectant solution and mops; any cloths used are disposed of with the clinical waste.</li>
          <li>Clean any tables and other furniture, furnishings or toys affected by blood, urine, faeces or vomit using a disinfectant.</li>
          <li>Ensure that children do not share tooth brushes, which are also soaked weekly in sterilising solution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Nits and head lice</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Nits and head lice are not an excludable condition; although in exceptional cases [we/I] may ask a parent to keep the child away until the infestation has cleared.</li>
          <li>On identifying cases of head lice, we inform all parents ask them to treat their child and all the family if they are found to have head lice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Procedures for children with allergies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When children start at the setting we ask their parents if their child suffers from any known allergies. This is recorded on the Registration Form.</li>
          <li>If a child has an allergy, we complete a risk assessment form to detail the following:
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">
              <li>The allergen (i.e. the substance, material or living creature the child is allergic to such as nuts, eggs, bee stings, cats etc).</li>
              <li>The nature of the allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic shock reaction, including rash, reddening of skin, swelling, breathing problems etc).</li>
              <li>What to do in case of allergic reactions, any medication used and how it is to be used (e.g. Epipen).</li>
              <li>Control measures - such as how the child can be prevented from contact with the allergen.</li>
              <li>Review measures.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>This risk assessment form is kept in the child's personal file and a copy is displayed where [our staff/I] can see it.</li>
          <li>A health care plan will also be completed.</li>
          <li>Generally, no nuts or nut products are used within the setting.</li>
          <li>Parents are made aware so that no nut or nut products are accidentally brought in, for example to a party.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Insurance requirements for children with allergies and disabilities</h3>
        <p>If necessary, our insurance will include children with any disability or allergy, but certain procedures must be strictly adhered to as set out below. For children suffering life threatening conditions, or requiring invasive treatments; written confirmation from our insurance provider must be obtained to extend the insurance.</p>
        <p>At all times we ensure that the administration of medication is compliant with the Safeguarding and Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Oral medication:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Asthma inhalers are now regarded as 'oral medication' by insurers and so documents do not need to be forwarded to [our/my] insurance provider. Oral medications must be prescribed by a GP or have manufacturer's instructions clearly written on them.</li>
          <li>We must be provided with clear written instructions on how to administer such medication.</li>
          <li>We adhere to all risk assessment procedures for the correct storage and administration of the medication.</li>
          <li>We must have the parents or guardians prior written consent. This consent must be kept on file. It is not necessary to forward copy documents to our insurance provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Life-saving medication and invasive treatments:</strong></h4>
        <p>These include adrenaline injections (Epipens) for anaphylactic shock reactions (caused by allergies to nuts, eggs etc) or invasive treatments such as rectal administration of Diazepam (for epilepsy).</p>
        <p>We must have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a letter/care plan from the child's GP/consultant stating the child's condition and what medication if any is to be administered;</li>
          <li>written consent from the parent or guardian allowing [our staff/me] to administer medication; and</li>
          <li>proof of training in the administration of such medication by the child's GP, a district nurse, children's nurse specialist or a community paediatric nurse.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p>To ensure the safety, privacy, and wellbeing of all children in our care, this policy outlines the restrictions on mobile phone use by parents and visitors within the nursery premises. It is in accordance with Ofsted safeguarding guidance and statutory requirements under the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS).</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Policy Statement</h2>

        <p>The use of mobile phones, smart devices, or any equipment capable of capturing images or videos is strictly prohibited within all areas of the nursery where children are present.</p>

        <p>This includes arrival, departure, and any time spent inside the nursery building or outdoor play areas.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Rationale</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Ofsted requires early years settings to implement robust safeguarding measures, including policies that govern the use of mobile phones and cameras.</li>
          <li>The presence of mobile devices poses a potential risk to children's privacy and safety, particularly regarding the unauthorized capture or sharing of images.</li>
          <li>This policy supports our commitment to creating a focused, respectful, and secure environment for all children.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Implementation</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Parents and visitors must switch off or silence their mobile phones before entering the nursery.</li>
          <li>If a call must be taken or made, we kindly ask that you step outside the building.</li>
          <li>Staff are instructed to politely remind parents of this policy when necessary.</li>
          <li>In cases of repeated non-compliance, management reserves the right to address the issue formally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Exceptions</h2>

        <p>Emergency situations may be discussed with the Nursery Manager, who will determine appropriate action.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Review</h2>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>No child is excluded from participating in our setting who may, for any reason, not yet be toilet trained and who may still be wearing nappies or equivalent. We work with parents towards toilet training, unless there are medical or other developmental reasons why this may not be appropriate at the time.</p>

        <p>We provide nappy changing facilities and exercise good hygiene practices in order to accommodate children who are not yet toilet trained.</p>

        <p>We see toilet training as a self-care skill that children have the opportunity to learn with the full support and non-judgemental concern of adults.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Our key persons have a list of personalised changing times for the children in their care who are in nappies or 'pull-ups'; and change nappies according to this schedule, or more frequently where necessary. They must leave the door open to the toilet but given children privacy for when changing nappies and clothes.</li>
          <li>We encourage young children from two years to normally wear pull ups, or other types of trainer pants, as soon as they are comfortable with this and if their parents agree.</li>
          <li>Babies and young children are changed within sight of other staff whilst maintaining their dignity and privacy at all times.</li>
          <li>Our changing area is warm, with a safe area to lay children and no bright lights shining down in their eyes.</li>
          <li>Each child has their own basket to hand with their nappies or pull ups and changing wipes.</li>
          <li>Our staff put on gloves and aprons before changing starts and the areas are prepared. Baby wipes are put down on the changing mat freshly for each child. Gloves are not always required for a wet nappy where there is no risk of infection, however, gloves are always available for those staff who choose to wear them. Gloves are always work for a 'soiled' nappy.</li>
          <li>All our staff are familiar with our hygiene procedures and carry these out when changing nappies. They must dispose of every nappy in the nappy sack includes wet nappy.</li>
          <li>Our staff never turn their back on a child or leave them unattended whilst they are on the changing mat.</li>
          <li>We are gentle when changing; we avoid pulling faces and making negative comments about 'nappy contents'.</li>
          <li>We do not make inappropriate comments about children's genitals when changing their nappies.</li>
          <li>In addition, we ensure that nappy changing is relaxed and a time to promote independence in young children.</li>
          <li>We encourage children to take an interest in using the toilet; they may just want to sit on it and talk to a friend who is also using the toilet.</li>
          <li>We encourage children to wash their hands, and have soap and towels to hand. They should be allowed time for some play as they explore the water and the soap and talk to them as to the reasons why they have to flush the toilet and wash hands after toileting.</li>
          <li>We do not use anti-bacterial hand wash liquid or soap for young children; young skin is quite delicate and anti-bacterial products kill off certain good bacteria that children need to develop their own natural resistance to infection.</li>
          <li>Older children access the toilet when they have the need to and are encouraged to be independent.</li>
          <li>We dispose of nappies and pull ups hygienically. Any soil (faeces) in nappies or pull ups is never flushed but put in nappy sacks and put in the bin. Cloth nappies, trainer pants and ordinary pants that have been wet or soiled are bagged for parents to take home.</li>
          <li>We have a 'duty of care' towards children's personal needs. If children are left in wet or soiled nappies/pull ups in the setting this may constitute neglect [and will be a disciplinary matter.</li>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We believe that children benefit most from early years education and care when parents and settings work together in partnership.</p>

        <p>Our aim is to support parents as their children's first and most important educators by involving them in their children's education and in the full life of our setting. We also aim to support parents in their own continuing education and personal development.</p>

        <p>Some parents are less well represented in early years settings; these include fathers, parents who live apart from their children, but who still play a part in their lives, as well as working parents. In carrying out the following procedures, we will ensure that all parents are included.</p>

        <p>When we refer to 'parents', we mean both mothers and fathers; these include both natural or birth parents, as well as step-parents and parents who do not live with their children but have contact with them and play a part in their lives. 'Parents' also includes same sex parents, as well as foster parents.</p>

        <p>The Children Act (1989) defines parental responsibility as 'all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property'. (For a full explanation of who has parental responsibility, refer to the Safeguarding Children (Pre-school Learning Alliance 2013.)</p>

          <li>We consult with all parents to find out what works best for them.</li>

We will seek parental permission unless there are reasons not to in order to protect the safety of the child. Reference is made to our Information Sharing Policy on seeking consent for disclosure.</li>

          <li>Our key persons meet regularly with parents to discuss their child's progress and to share concerns if they arise.</li>
          <li>Where applicable, our key persons work with parents to carry out an agreed plan to support special educational needs.</li>

        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We follow the guidelines of the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) for the reporting of accidents and incidents. Child protection matters or behavioural incidents between children are not regarded as incidents and there are separate procedures for this.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <h3>Our accident book:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>is kept in a safe and secure place;</li>
          <li>is accessible to [our staff/my assistants] and volunteers, who all know how to complete it; and</li>
          <li>is reviewed monthly to identify any potential or actual hazards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Reporting accidents and incidents</h3>
        <p><strong>Ofsted is notified as soon as possible, but at least within 14 days, of any instances which involve:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>food poisoning affecting two or more children looked after on our premises</li>
          <li>a serious accident or injury to, or serious illness of, a child in our care and the action [we/I] take in response</li>
          <li>the death of a child in our care</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Local child protection agencies are informed of any serious accident or injury to a child, or the death of any child, while in our care and we act on any advice given by those agencies.</p>

        <p>Any food poisoning affecting two or more children or adults on our premises is reported to the local Environmental Health Department.</p>

        <p>We meet our legal requirements in respect of [the safety of our employees/my safety and the safety of my employees] and the public by complying with RIDDOR. We report to the Local Authority (LA). Please note that providers on school premises or domestic premises report to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Any work-related accident leading to an injury to a member of the public (child or adult), for which they are taken directly to the hospital for treatment.</li>
          <li>Any work-related accident leading to a specified injury to [one of our employees/me or one of my employees]. Specified injuries include injuries such as fractured bones, the loss of consciousness due to a head injury, serious burns or amputations.</li>
          <li>Any work-related accident leading to an injury to [one of our employees/me or one of my employees] which results in them being unable to work for seven consecutive days. All work-related injuries that lead to [one of our employees/me or one of my employees] being incapacitated for three or more days are recorded in our accident book.</li>
          <li>When [one of our employees/I or one of my employees] suffers from a reportable occupational disease or illness as specified by the HSE.</li>
          <li>Any death, of a child or adult, that occurs in connection with a work-related accident.</li>
          <li>Any dangerous occurrences. This may be an event that causes injury or fatalities or an event that does not cause an accident, but could have done; such as a gas leak.</li>
          <li>Information for reporting incidents to the Local Authority or Health and Safety Executive is provided in the Accident Record (Pre-school Learning Alliance 2017). Any dangerous occurrence is recorded in our incident book (see below).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Incident book</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We have ready access to telephone numbers for emergency services, including the local police. Where we are responsible for the premises we have contact numbers for the gas and electricity emergency services, and a carpenter and plumber. Where we rent premises we ensure we have access to the person responsible and that there is a shared procedure for dealing with emergencies.</li>
          <li>We ensure that our staff and volunteers carry out all health and safety procedures to minimise risk and that they know what to do in an emergency.</li>
          <li>On discovery of an incident, we report it to the appropriate emergency services – fire, police, ambulance – if those services are needed.</li>
          <li>If an incident occurs before any children arrive, our manager risk assess[es] this situation and decide[s] if the premises are safe to receive children. Our manager may decide to offer a limited service or to close the setting.</li>
          <li>Where an incident occurs whilst the children are in our care and it is necessary to evacuate the premises/area, we follow the procedures in our Fire Safety and Emergency Evacuation Policy or, when on an outing, the procedures identified in the risk assessment for the outing.</li>
          <li>If a crime may have been committed, [we/I] ask all adults witness to the incident to make a witness statement including the date and time of the incident, what they saw or heard, what they did about it and their full name and signature.</li>
          <li>We keep an incident book for recording major incidents, including some of those that are reportable to the Local Authority or Health and Safety Executive as above.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>These incidents include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>a break in, burglary, or theft of personal or our setting's property</li>
          <li>an intruder gaining unauthorised access to our premises</li>
          <li>a fire, flood, gas leak or electrical failure</li>
          <li>an attack on an adult or child on our premises or nearby</li>
          <li>any racist incident involving families or our staff on the setting's premises</li>
          <li>a notifiable disease or illness, or an outbreak of food poisoning affecting two or more children looked after on our premises</li>
          <li>the death of a child or adult</li>
          <li>a terrorist attack, or threat of one</li>
        </ul>

        <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
          <li>In the incident book we record the date and time of the incident, the nature of the event, who was affected, what was done about it or if it was reported to the police, and if so a crime number. Any follow up, or insurance claim made, is also recorded.</li>
          <li>In the event of a terrorist attack, we follow the advice of the emergency services with regard to evacuation, medical aid and contacting children's families. Our standard Fire Safety and Emergency Evacuation Policy will be followed and our staff will take charge of their key children. The incident is recorded when the threat is averted.</li>
          <li>In the unlikely event of a child dying on [our/my] premises, through cot death in the case of a baby for example, the emergency services are called and the advice of these services are followed.</li>
          <li>The incident book is not for recording issues of concern involving a child. This is recorded in the child's own file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Education Inspection Framework</h3>
        <p>As required under the Education Inspection Framework, we maintain a summary record of all accidents, exclusions, children taken off roll, incidents of poor behaviour and discrimination, including racist incidents, and complaints and resolutions.</p>

      <div class="header-info">
        <strong>Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd</strong><br>
        Adopted: 23/08/2025 | To be reviewed: 23/08/2026
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We believe that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance. We make our setting a safe and healthy place for children, parents, staff and volunteers by assessing and minimising the hazards and risks to enable the children to thrive in a healthy and safe environment.</p>

        <p><strong>Risk assessment means:</strong></p>
        <p>Taking note of aspects of your workplace and activities that could cause harm, either to yourself or to others, and deciding what needs to be done to prevent that harm, making sure this is adhered to.</p>

        <p>The law does not require that all risk is eliminated, but that 'reasonable precaution' is taken. This is particularly important when balancing the need for children to be able to take appropriate risks through physically challenging play. Children need the opportunity to work out what is not safe and what they should do when faced with a risk.</p>

        <p>Health and safety risk assessments inform procedures. Staff and parents should be involved in reviewing risk assessments and procedures – they are the ones with first-hand knowledge as to whether the control measures are effective – and they can give an informed view to help update procedures accordingly.</p>

        <p><strong>This policy is based on the five steps below:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identification of a risk:</strong> Where is it and what is it?</li>
          <li><strong>Who is at risk:</strong> Childcare staff, children, parents, cooks, cleaners etc?</li>
          <li><strong>Assessment as to whether the level of a risk is high, medium, low.</strong> This takes into account both the likelihood of it happening, as well as the possible impact if it did.</li>
          <li><strong>Control measures to reduce/eliminate risk:</strong> What will you need to do, or ensure others will do, in order to reduce that risk?</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring and review:</strong> How do you know if what you have said is working, or is thorough enough? If it is not working, it will need to be amended, or maybe there is a better solution.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

Schools and colleges must have regard to this guidance when carrying out their duties to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. Other childcare providers may also find it helpful to refer to this guidance. Unless otherwise stated, 'school' in this guidance means all schools, whether maintained, non-maintained or independent, including academies and free schools, alternative provision academies and pupil referral units. 'School' includes maintained nursery schools. 'College' means further education colleges and sixth form colleges as established under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.

          <li>All staff understand how to escalate their concerns in the event that they feel either the local authority and/or their own organisation has not acted adequately to safeguard and know how to follow local safeguarding procedures to resolve professional disputes between staff and organisations.</li>
          <li>All staff understand what the organisation expects of them in terms of their required behaviour and conduct, and follow our policies and procedures on positive behaviour, online safety (including use of cameras and mobile phones), whistleblowing and dignity at work.</li>
          <li>Children have a key person to build a relationship with, and are supported to articulate any worries, concerns or complaints that they may have in an age appropriate way.</li>
          <li>All staff understand our policy on promoting positive behaviour and follow it in relation to children showing aggression towards other children.</li>
          <li>We provide adequate and appropriate staffing resources to meet the needs of children. Sufficient resources and time are allocated to enable the designated person and the deputy to carry out their roles effectively, including the assessment of pupils and attendance of strategy discussions and other necessary meetings; for e.g. child protection conferences and core group meetings and ensuring a provision of Early Help.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Recruitment and DBS checks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Applicants for posts within the provision are clearly informed that the positions are exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.</li>
          <li>Staff are informed of the need to carry out 'DBS' checks with the Discloser Barring Service before they are allowed to be left alone with any of the children at any one time. Staff's post can only be confirmed on the receipt of DBS disclosure.</li>
          <li>Where applications are rejected because of information that has been disclosed, applicants have the right to know and to challenge incorrect information.</li>
          <li>We abide by Ofsted requirements in respect of references and Discloser Disbarring Service checks for staff and volunteers, to ensure that no disqualified person or unsuitable person works, lives at the provision or has access to the children.</li>
          <li>We record information about staff qualifications, and the identity checks and vetting processes that have been completed including:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
              <li>the DBS reference number;</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Volunteers</h3>
        <p>Volunteers do not work unsupervised.</p>
        <p><strong>Volunteers must:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>be aged 17 or over;</li>

          <li>details of who obtained it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">All staff and volunteers are informed that they are expected to disclose any convictions, cautions, court orders or reprimands and warnings which may affect their suitability to work with children (whether received before or during their employment with us).</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">From 31 August 2018, staff and volunteers in childcare settings that are not based on domestic premises are not required to notify their line manager if anyone in their household (including family members, lodgers, partners etc.) has any relevant convictions, cautions, court orders, reprimands or warnings or has been barred from, or had registration refused or cancelled in relation to any childcare provision or have had orders made in relation to care of their children. Disqualification and Childcare Regulations 2018, and Disqualification under the Childcare Act guidance, effective from 31 August 2018.</p>

        <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
          <li>Staff receive regular supervision, which includes discussion of any safeguarding issues, and their performance, their own health and wellbeing and learning needs are reviewed regularly.</li>
          <li>In addition to induction and supervision, staff are provided with clear expectations in relation to their behaviour [outlined in the employee handbook].</li>
          <li>We abide by the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act (2006) and the disclosure and barring service requirements in respect of any person who is dismissed from our employment or resigns in circumstances that would otherwise have led to dismissal for reasons of child protection concern.</li>
          <li>Anyone who has harmed or may pose a risk to a child is referred to the DBS;</li>

          <li>We have procedures for recording the details of visitors to the setting. All visitors must sign in the signing in book. Visitors must NEVER be left alone.</li>
          <li>We take security steps to ensure that we have control over who comes into the provision so that no unauthorised person has unsupervised access to the children.</li>
          <li>We take steps to ensure children are not photographed or filmed on video for any other purpose than to record their development or their participation in events organised by us. Parents sign a consent form and have access to records holding visual images of their child.</li>
          <li>The designated person will inform the designated officer at the first opportunity of every significant safeguarding concern; however, this should not delay any referrals being made.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- KEY COMMITMENT 2 -->
      <div class="policy-section" style="background-color: #fff3e0; padding: 20px; margin-top: 30px; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800;">
        <h2>Key commitment 2</h2>
        <p><strong>We are committed to responding promptly and appropriately to all incidents or concerns of abuse that may occur and to work with statutory agencies in accordance with the procedures that are set down in the London Child Protection procedures for dealing with allegations of abuse against staff and volunteers. 'What to do if you're worried a child is being abused' (HMG 2015). & 'working to safeguard children (HMG2015)' 'The Prevent Duty 2015', Statutory Framework for EYFS DFE 2014, Disqualification Under the Children Act 2006, and the Care Act 2014.</strong></p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Responding to suspicions of abuse:</h3>
        <p>We ensure that all staff have an understanding of the additional vulnerabilities that arise from special educational needs and/or disabilities, plus inequalities of race, gender, language, religion, sexual orientation or culture, and that these receive full consideration in relation to child, young person or vulnerable adult protection.</p>

        <p>We acknowledge that abuse of children can take different forms. Safeguarding action may be needed to protect children and young people from: Neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, bullying, racist, disability and homophobic, gender base violence, violence against women and girls, radicalisation and or extremist behaviour, child sexual exploitation and trafficking, gang related, teenage relationship abuse, substance misuse, alcohol abuse, domestic violence, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, poor parenting, self-harming. Some of the items listed above may not be relevant to children in the nursery however they may encounter or witness some of these outside the nursery and children may disclose certain attributes which the staff need to be aware off. When children are suffering from physical, sexual or emotional abuse, or may be experiencing neglect, this may be demonstrated through the things they say (direct or indirect disclosure) or through changes in their appearance or:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>significant changes in their behaviour;</li>
          <li>deterioration in their general well-being;</li>
          <li>their comments which may give cause for concern, or the things they say (direct or indirect disclosure);</li>
          <li>changes in their appearance, their behaviour, or their play;</li>
          <li>unexplained bruising, marks or signs of possible abuse or neglect; and</li>
          <li>any reason to suspect neglect or abuse outside the setting.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
          <li>We understand how to identify children who may be in need of early help, how to access services for them</li>
          <li>We understand that we should refer a child who meets the s17 Children Act 1989 child in need definition to local authority children's social work services</li>
          <li>We understand that we should refer any child who may be at risk of significant harm to local authority children's social work services.</li>
          <li>We are aware that children's vulnerability is potentially increased when they are privately fostered and when we know that a child is being cared for under a private fostering arrangement, we inform our local authority children's social care team.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">We are prepared to take action if we have concerns about the welfare of a child who fails to arrive at a session when expected. The designated person will take immediate action to contact the child's parent to seek an explanation for the child's absence and ensure that the child is safe and well. If no contact is made with the child's parents and the designated person has reason to believe that the child is at risk of significant harm, the relevant professionals are contacted immediately, and LSCB procedures are followed. If the child has current involvement with social care, the social worker is notified on the day of the unexplained absence.</p>

        <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
          <li>We take into account factors affecting parental capacity, such as social exclusion, domestic violence, parents' drug or alcohol abuse, faiths and beliefs from family members and society, mental or physical illness or parents' learning disability.</li>
          <li>We are aware of other factors that affect children's vulnerability such as abuse of disabled children, fabricated or induced illness, child abuse linked to beliefs in spirit possession, sexual exploitation of children such as through internet abuse and Female Genital Mutilation that may affect or may have affected children and young people using our provision.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Children with special educational needs and disabilities</h3>
        <p>Additional barriers can exist when recognising abuse and neglect in this group of children. This can include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assumptions that indicators of possible abuse such as behaviour, mood and injury relate to the child's impairment without further exploration;</li>
          <li>Assumptions that children with SEN and disabilities can be disproportionally impacted by things like bullying- without outwardly showing any signs;</li>
          <li>Communication barriers and difficulties</li>
          <li>Reluctance to challenge carers, (professionals may over empathise with carers because of the perceived stress of caring for a disabled child)</li>
          <li>Disabled children often rely on a wide network of carers to meet their basic needs and therefore the potential risk of exposure to abusive behaviour can be increased</li>
          <li>A disabled child's understanding of abuse</li>
          <li>Lack of choice/participation</li>
          <li>Isolation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)</h3>
        <p>FGM is a cultural practice and is illegal in the UK and is considered a violation of human rights by the United Nations. It is considered as a form of child abuse with harmful consequences in short and long term. Individuals, groups in relevant communities and professionals in all agencies need to be alert to the possibility of a girl being at risk of FGM, or already having suffered FGM.</p>

        <p>In the UK, FGM is a criminal offence and a harmful form of child abuse. It is illegal to practice in the UK and/or anyone involved in taking girl outside of the UK to have FGM carried out will be punished under the FGM Act 2003 and Serious Crime Act 2015. LBWF follows a comprehensive approach comprising care, prevention, enforcement through promoting protection measures and safeguarding young girls from FGM. The Serious Crime Act 2015 (Home Office, 2015) introduced a duty on teachers (and other professionals) to notify the police of known cases of female genital mutilation where it appears to have been carried out on a girl under the age of 18. Our school will operate in accordance with the statutory requirements relating to this issue, and in line with existing local safeguarding procedures.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Harmful Sexual Behaviour (HSB) in an Educational Setting</h3>
        <p>Unless the outcome of the assessment is 'Healthy', the school/setting should then compile a chronology of relevant incidents to support pattern mapping and complete a referral to the Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH).</p>

        <p>The setting / establishment is required to implement a School/setting's Safety and Support plan for both the child that has harmed and the child that has been harmed. Throughout the process it is desirable that parents are engaged and informed.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Referrals:</strong></h4>
        <p>Where a child has caused significant harm to another child, through sexual abuse or serious physical or emotional abuse, the setting/establishment will make separate referrals to children's Social Care (MASH) for both the harmed and the harmer.</p>

        <p>The setting/establishment should be mindful of the sections in the London Child Protection Procedures concerning "Children Harming Others" and "Safeguarding Sexually Active Children" and work closely with Social Care, Harmful Sexual Behaviour Lead, Police and other agencies following the investigation of a referral.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Harmful Sexual Behaviour (HSB): Local Authority Support for Schools/Settings</strong></h4>
        <p>The local authority Harmful Sexual Behaviour Lead is available to provide support and advice to educational establishments.</p>

        <p><strong>Key contact:</strong></p>
        <p>Tracey Goddard - Borough Lead - Harmful Sexual Behaviour<br>
        Tracey.Goddard@walthamforest.gov.uk</p>

        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Other safeguarding concerns</h3>
        <p>We also make ourselves aware that some children and young people are affected by gang activity, by complex, multiple or organised abuse, through forced marriage or honour-based violence or may be victims of child trafficking and radicalisation and extremism. While this may be less likely to affect young children in our care, we may become aware of any of these factors affecting older children and young people who we may come into contact with.</p>

        <p>We are also aware that some families may be drawn into believing that their child may be possessed by witchcraft or the devil and may be required to perform an exorcism by their Church (preacher, Priest,) or Mullah from (Islamic faiths) or other religious beliefs. Exorcism can be performed in many ways, such as locking the child in a room, severe beatings, burns, starving the child or abandoning them from the house. This is regarded as child abuse and families will be reported to Social Care, Police and other relevant authorities. Staff need to be aware of recognising this form of abuse, and if they are concerned, they must follow the Child Protection Policy.</p>

        <p>Recognising this form of abuse is not easy and staff must be aware of what the child has disclosed, the parents or a family member. Staff must be aware of signs and symptoms of abuse as listed above. I.e Marks, unexplained injuries, behaviour patterns, weight loss, withdrawn, scared burn marks etc.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Prevent Duty</h3>
        <p>We also make aware of 'Prevent Duty' by assessing the risk of children being drawn into terrorism. This could be listening to a child if they disclose something of significant, where parents' behaviour is of concern or if they disclose something in confidence which could put children in danger or expose them to an act of violence or terrorism. In which case will be reported immediately to the local authority safeguarding board.</p>

        <p>We make sure that staff have training that gives them the knowledge and confidence to identify children at risk of being drawn into terrorism, and to challenge extremist ideas which can be used to legitimise terrorism.</p>

        <p>Although young children may not have access to direct internet however they may be exposed outside the nursery. We ensure children are safe from terrorist and extremist material when accessing the internet.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Recording and referrals</h3>
        <p>Where we believe a child in our care or known to us may be affected by any of these factors, we follow the procedure for reporting child protection concerns.</p>

        <p>Where such evidence is apparent, the child's key person makes a dated record of the details of the concern and discusses what to do with a member of staff who is acting as the 'designated person'. If another member of staff who is not the key person to the child has a suspicion of abuse, they must still notify the designated child protection person. These records are signed and dated and kept in the child's personal file, which is kept securely and confidentially. Where a child's file is of a sensitive nature i.e. a child protection issue then the child's file is marked with a red sticker, which would show that this child's other personal details are kept in another file.</p>

        <p>We refer concerns to the local authority children's social care department and co-operate fully in any subsequent investigation. We would also see if the Common Assessment Framework is being used, where a referral between agencies or a multi-agency approach is likely, so that information can be shared between agencies. The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) is there to help and support the child and families.</p>

        <p><strong>NB</strong> In some cases this may mean the police, or another agency identified by the Waltham forest Safeguarding Children's Board. (LADO)</p>
        <p><strong>The designated officer for Early Years is:</strong> Jennifer Knight 0208 496 3646/07866314 144.</p>
        <p><strong>Manger of safeguarding and LADO</strong> Jillian Nash 0208 496 3646/07791 559 789</p>
        <p><strong>Mash Team:</strong> 0208 496 2310/2317</p>

        <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
          <li>We take care not to influence the outcome either through the way we speak to children or by asking misleading questions to children.</li>
          <li>We take account of the need to protect young people aged 16-19 as defined by the Childcare Act 2006. This may include students or school children on work placement, young employees or young parents. Where abuse is suspected, we follow the procedure for reporting any other child protection concerns. The views of the young person will always be taken into account, but the setting may override the young person's refusal to consent to share information if it feels that it is necessary to prevent a crime from being committed or intervene where one may have been committed, or to prevent harm to a child or adult. Sharing confidential information without consent is done only where not sharing it could be worse than the outcome of having shared it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Recording suspicions of abuse and disclosures</h3>
        <p>Where a child makes comments to a member of staff that give cause for concern (disclosure), a member of staff observes signs or signals that give cause for concern, such as significant changes in behaviour; deterioration in general well-being; unexplained bruising, marks or signs of possible abuse or neglect, that member of staff:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>listens to the child, offers reassurance and gives assurance that she or he will take action;</li>
          <li>does not ask misleading questions</li>
          <li>makes a written record that forms an objective record of the observation or disclosure that includes:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
              <li>the date and time of the observation or the disclosure;</li>
              <li>the exact words spoken by the child as far as possible;</li>
              <li>the name of the person to whom the concern was reported, with date and time; and</li>
              <li>the names of any other person present at the time.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These records are signed and dated and kept in the child's personal file, which is kept securely and confidentially or incase of disclosure under the 'Prevent Duty', this is shared immediately with the Manager, who will contact the 'Local Authority Safeguarding Board'</p>

        <p>The manager acting as the Designated Lead Person is informed of the issue at the earliest opportunity.</p>

        <p>Where the Local Safeguarding Children Board stipulates the process for recording and sharing concerns, we include those procedures alongside this procedure and follow the steps set down by the Local Safeguarding Children Board.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Making a referral to the local authority social care team</h3>
        <p>The Local Safeguarding Children's Board contains procedures for making a referral to the local children's social care team, as well as a template form for recording concerns and making a referral. This is based on 'What to do if you are worried a child is being abused' (HMG 2015).</p>

        <p>We keep a copy of this document alongside procedures set down by our Local Safeguarding Children Board.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Informing parents</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents are normally the first point of contact. We discuss concerns with parents to gain their view of events, unless we feel this may put the child in greater danger.</li>
          <li>We inform parents when we make a record of concerns in their child's file, and that we also make a note of any discussion we have with them regarding a concern.</li>
          <li>If a suspicion of abuse warrants referral to social care, parents are informed at the same time that the referral will be made, except where the guidance of the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board /London Borough of Hackney does not allow this, for example, where it is believed that the child may be placed in greater danger.</li>
          <li>This will usually be the case where the parent is the likely abuser. In these cases, the social workers will inform parents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Liaison with other agencies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We work within the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board guidelines.</li>
          <li>We have the current version of 'What to do if you're worried a child is being abused 2015' for parents and staff, and all staff are familiar with what to do if they have concerns.</li>
          <li>We have procedures for contacting the local authority on child protection issues, including maintaining a list of names, addresses and telephone numbers of social workers, to ensure that it is easy, in any emergency, for the setting and social services to work well together.</li>
          <li>We notify the registration authority (Ofsted) of any incident or accident and any changes in our arrangements which may affect the well-being of children or where an allegation of abuse is made against a member of staff (whether the allegations relate to harm or abuse committed on our premises or elsewhere). Notifications to Ofsted are made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but at the latest within 14 days of the allegations being made.</li>
          <li>Contact details for the local National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) are also kept.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Allegations against staff</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We ensure that all parents know how to complain about the behaviour or actions of staff or volunteers within the provision, or anyone living or working on the premises occupied by the setting, which may include an allegation of abuse.</li>
          <li>We respond to any inappropriate behaviour displayed by members of staff, or any other person working with the children, which includes:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
              <li>inappropriate sexual comments;</li>
              <li>excessive one-to-one attention beyond the requirements of their usual role and responsibilities, or</li>
              <li>inappropriate sharing of images.</li>
              <li>Inappropriate handling of children in the nursery</li>
              <li>Using negative language towards children and undermining their confidence</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We follow the guidance of the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board (LADO) when responding to any complaint that a member of staff, or volunteer within the provision, or anyone living or working on the premises occupied by the setting, has abused a child.</li>
          <li>We respond to any disclosure by children or staff that abuse by a member of staff or volunteer within the setting, or anyone living or working on the premises occupied by the setting, may have taken, or is taking place, by first recording the details of any such alleged incident.</li>
          <li>We refer any such complaint immediately to the local authority's social care department to investigate. We also report any such alleged incident to Ofsted and what measures we have taken. We are aware that it is an offence not to do this.</li>
          <li>We co-operate entirely with any investigation carried out by children's social care in conjunction with the police.</li>
          <li>Where the management team and children's social care agree it is appropriate in the circumstances, the Director will suspend the member of staff on full pay, or the volunteer, for the duration of the investigation. This is not an indication of admission that the alleged incident has taken place, but is to protect the staff as well as children and families throughout the process.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key commitment 3</h2>
        <p><strong>We are committed to promoting awareness of child abuse issues throughout our training and learning programmes for adults. It is also committed to empowering young children, through its early childhood curriculum (EYFS 2014), promoting their right to be strong, resilient and listened to.</strong></p>

        <p>It is aware of 'Prevent Duty' and promotes 'British Values' through planning and activities, and by keeping children safe from dangers of radicalisation and extremism.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Training</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We seek out training opportunities for all adults involved in the setting to ensure that they can recognise the signs and signals of possible physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse and neglect and of children being radicalised into extremist terrorism and that they are aware of the local authority guidelines for making referrals.</li>
          <li>We ensure that designated persons receive training in accordance with that recommended by the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board.</li>
          <li>We ensure that all staff know the procedures for reporting and recording their concerns in the setting.</li>
          <li>We provide in house as well as external training for our staff.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Planning</h3>
        <p>The layout of the rooms allows for constant supervision. No child is left alone with staff or volunteers in a one-to-one situation without being visible to others or seen on camera through CCTV.</p>

        <p>We promote 'British Values' by understanding and celebrating all cultures and respecting all faiths through activities and explaining why this is important within our community.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Curriculum</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We introduce key elements of keeping children safe into our programme to promote the personal, social and emotional development of all children, so that they may grow to be strong, resilient and listened to and that they develop an understanding of why and how to keep safe.</li>
          <li>We create within the setting a culture of value and respect for the individual, having positive regard for children's heritage arising from their colour, ethnicity, languages spoken at home, cultural and social background.</li>
          <li>We ensure that this is carried out in a way that is developmentally appropriate for the children.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>All suspicions and investigations are kept confidential and shared only with those who need to know. Any information is shared under the guidance of the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Support to families</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We believe in building trusting and supportive relationships with families, staff and volunteers in the group.</li>
          <li>We make clear to parents our role and responsibilities in relation to child protection, such as for the reporting of concerns, providing information, monitoring of the child, and liaising at all times with the local children's social care team.</li>
          <li>We will continue to welcome the child and the family whilst investigations are being made in relation to any alleged abuse.</li>
          <li>We follow the Child Protection Plan as set by the child's social care worker in relation to the setting's designated role and tasks in supporting that child and their family, subsequent to any investigation.</li>
          <li>Confidential records kept on a child are shared with the child's parents or those who have parental responsibility for the child in accordance with the Confidentiality and Client Access to Records procedure and only if appropriate under the guidance of the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board.</li>

        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>This setting believes that the health and safety of all staff is of paramount importance and that all staff have the right to work in a safe environment. We support safe working both on and off the premises, acknowledging the needs and diversity of children and their families.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All staff in the building early in the morning, or late in the evening, ensure doors and windows are locked.</li>
          <li>Where possible, at least the first two members of staff to arrive in the building arrive together, and the last two members of staff in the building leave together.</li>
          <li>Where it is necessary for staff to work alone (without children present), an assessment of risks should be made. When working alone a colleague should be notified of their movements, and staff should be vigilant when entering or leaving the building.</li>
          <li>Visitors are generally only allowed access with prior appointments and only admitted once their identity has been verified.</li>
          <li>Minimal petty cash is kept on the premises.</li>
          <li>Members of staff make a note in the diary of meetings they are attending, who they are meeting and when they are expected back.</li>
          <li>Managers have good liaison with local police and ask for advice on safe practice where there are issues or concerns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Dealing with agitated parents in the setting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If a parent appears to be angry, mentally agitated or possibly hostile, two members of staff will lead the parent away from the children to a less open area, but will not shut the door behind them.</li>
          <li>If the person is standing, staff will remain standing.</li>
          <li>Members of staff will try to empathise and ensure that the language they use can be easily understood.</li>
          <li>Staff will speak in low, even tones, below the voice level of the parent.</li>
          <li>Members of staff will make it clear that they want to listen and seek solutions.</li>
          <li>If the person makes threats and continues to be angry, members of staff make it clear that they will be unable to discuss the issue until the person stops shouting or being abusive while avoiding potentially inflammatory expressions such as 'calm down' or 'be reasonable'.</li>
          <li>If threats or abuse continues, members of staff will explain that the police will be called and emphasise the inappropriateness of such behaviour in front of children.</li>
          <li>After the event, details are recorded in the child's personal file together with any decisions made with the parents to rectify the situation and any correspondence regarding the incident.</li>

      <div class="header-info">
        <strong>Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd</strong><br>
        Updated: 2024
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Attendance Standard</h2>

        <p>Regular attendance is a vital part of fulfilling your duties as a member of the Bright Kids Day nursery team. Absence from work places a strain on other members of staff at the nursery, unsettles the children, and generally disrupts the smooth running of the nursery as a whole.</p>

        <p>While it is sometimes necessary to be absent from work for serious illness, it is your responsibility to take care of your health to ensure that you are not regularly absent from the nursery.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedure for attendance</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>If employees are to work before their shift, staff must ensure they inform the nursery at the earliest convenience. Employees are expected to inform management before 7.00 am. Employees must inform the Manager on their personal phone before 7.30 am. After 7.30 am employee must call the nursery phone.</li>
          <li>When absent for more than one working day, staff must notify management by 3pm the day before. If staff fail to do this, the nursery has the right to decline them from working.</li>
          <li>When the staff members return to work, they must complete an absence statement. Proof of absence may be essential.</li>
          <li>Staff are not paid for absence, but in some cases, statutory Sick Pay SSP.</li>
          <li>Regular Absence: 3 or more occasions of absence over the course of 3 months are seen as a failure to meet policies and procedures regarding absence. This includes any periods for which a doctor's sick certification is given.
            <br><br>
            When a staff member fails to meet expectations the sickness disciplinary action will be introduced to monitor attendance. All staff members' health, personal and emotional needs will be considered at each stage of the disciplinary.

        <strong>Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd</strong><br>
        Adopted: 18/10/2025 | To be reviewed: 17/10/2026
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>Children benefit from being taken outside of the premises on visits or trips to local parks, or other suitable venues for activities which enhance their learning experiences. Where applicable: Our setting does not have direct access to outdoor provision on the premises and will need to take children out daily.] We ensure that there are procedures to keep children safe on outings; all staff and volunteers are aware of and follow the procedures as laid out below.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <h3>General Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All off-site activity has a clearly identified educational purpose with specific learning and development outcomes.</li>
          <li>There is a designated lead for each excursion who is clear about their responsibility as the designated lead.</li>
          <li>We ask parents to sign a general consent on registration for their children to be taken out on local short outings as a part of the daily activities of the setting. This general consent details the venues used for daily activities.</li>
          <li>We assess the risks for each local venue used for daily activities, which is reviewed regularly.</li>
          <li>We always ask parents to sign specific consent forms before major outings; and the risks are assessed before the outing takes place.</li>
          <li>If staff are 'borrowed' from another area to maintain ratios on an outing they are fully briefed about the children they are accompanying.</li>
          <li>Our manager and all staff taking part in the outing sign off every risk assessment.</li>
          <li>Children with allergies or other specific needs have a separate risk assessment completed i.e. child with allergies visiting a supermarket.</li>
          <li>An excursion will not go ahead if concerns are raised about its viability at any point.</li>
          <li>Procedures are followed at all times. The designated lead is always a level 3 trained.</li>
          <li>Staff have emergency contacts, medication and equipment needed for children.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Farm and zoo visits</h3>
        <p>Staff are aware of the risks posed by infections such as E.coli being contracted from animals. They are also aware of toxic substances used on farms that could be hazardous to health. Staff are vigilant of the natural dangers presented by a farm or zoo visit and conduct a risk assessment prior to the visit.</p>

        <ul style="margin-top: 15px;">
          <li>The venue is contacted in advance of the visit to ensure no recent outbreaks of E.coli or other infections. If there has been an outbreak the visit will be reviewed and may be postponed.</li>
          <li>Hands are washed and dried thoroughly after touching an animal.</li>
          <li>Nothing is consumed whilst going round the farm. Food is eaten away from animals, after thoroughly washing hands.</li>
          <li>Children are prevented from putting their faces against animals or hands in their own mouths.</li>
          <li>If animal droppings are touched, hands are washed and dried immediately.</li>
          <li>Shoes are cleaned and hands washed thoroughly as soon as possible on departure.</li>
          <li>Staff or volunteers who are or may be pregnant should avoid contact with pregnant ewes and may want to consult their own GP before the visit.</li>
          <li>Farmers have a responsibility to ensure that hand washing and drying facilities are available and are suitably located, that picnic areas are separate and clean, and that all other health and safety laws are fully observed.</li>
          <li>Any written outing risk assessments are made available for parents to see.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Staffing Ratios and Supervision</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>For group provision: Our adult to child ratio is high, normally one adult to two children, depending on their age, sensibility and the type of venue, as well as how it is to be reached.</li>
          <li>For group provision: A minimum of two staff accompany children on outings. Unless the whole setting is on an outing, a minimum of two staff also remain behind with the rest of the children.</li>
          <li>Named children are assigned to an individual staff member to ensure that each child is well supervised, that no child goes astray and that there is no unauthorised access to children. We ensure that all children on the outing are well supervised, that no child goes astray and that there is no unauthorised access to children.</li>
          <li>All children must wear a wristband.</li>
          <li>Staff frequently count their designated children and ensure children are strapped into prams or reins at all times on route.</li>
          <li>Staff will adhere to new ratios of 1:2 for babies and toddlers. However, if they take the children in the 6-seater buggy, then the ratio is 2:6 as long as the children are not taken out of the buggy.</li>
          <li>Staff will adhere to new ratios of 1:4 for preschool</li>
          <li>Children can only go on trips in groups of twelve or less, and go at separate times of the day.</li>
          <li>Management and seniors will be responsible for ensuring road safety and correct and accurate procedures are in place and followed accurately, before, during and after trips.</li>
          <li>Rooms are responsible for ensuring regular discussions with children about road safety, during circle time, before trips and during trips.</li>
          <li>Managers will carry out a checklist to ensure all policy points have been checked.</li>
          <li>Parents who accompany us on outings are responsible for their own child only. Where parents have undergone vetting with us as volunteers, they may be included in the adults to child ratio and have children allocated to them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Recording and Documentation</h3>
        <p>Outings are recorded in an outings record book kept in the setting, stating:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The date and time of the outing.</li>
          <li>The venue and mode of transport used.</li>
          <li>[The names of the staff members assigned to each of the children.]</li>
          <li>The time of return.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Equipment and Supplies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We take a mobile phone on outings, as well as supplies of tissues, wipes, spare clothing and nappies, medicines required for individual children, a mini first aid kit, snacks and water. The amount of equipment will vary and be consistent with the venue and the number of children, as well as how long they will be out for.</li>
          <li>We apply sun cream to children as needed and ensure they are dressed appropriately for the type of outing and weather conditions.</li>
          <li>We take a list of children with us with contact numbers of parents/carers, as well as an accident book and a copy of our Missing Child Policy.</li>
          <li>We provide children with badges or 'high viz' vests to wear that contain the name and setting telephone number – but not the name of the child.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Transport Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Records are kept of the vehicles used to transport children, with named drivers and appropriate insurance cover.</li>
          <li>We ensure that seat belts are worn whilst travelling in vehicles and that booster seats and child safety seats are used as appropriate to the age of the child.</li>
          <li>As a precaution, we ensure that children do not eat when travelling in vehicles.</li>
          <li>We ensure that contracted drivers are from reputable companies, do not have unsupervised access to the children and are not included in the ratios.</li>

        <strong>Bright Kids Day Nursery Ltd / Bright Kids Hackney Ltd</strong><br>
        Adopted: 25/08/2025 | To be reviewed: 25/08/2026
      </div>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We believe that children settle best when they have a key person to relate to, who knows them and their parents well, and who can meet their individual needs. Research shows that a key person approach benefits the child, the parents, the staff and the setting by providing secure relationships in which children thrive, parents have confidence, staff are committed and the setting is a happy and dedicated place to attend or work in.</p>

        <p>We want children to feel safe, stimulated and happy in the setting and to feel secure and comfortable with staff. We also want parents to have confidence in both their children's well-being and their role as active partners with the setting.</p>

        <p>We aim to make the setting a welcoming place where children settle quickly and easily because consideration has been given to the individual needs and circumstances of children and their families.</p>

        <p>The key person role is set out in the Safeguarding and Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage. Each setting must assign a key person for each child at the point of entry to the setting.</p>

        <p>The procedures set out a model for developing a key person approach that promotes effective and positive relationships for children who are in settings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>We allocate a key person before the child starts.</li>
          <li>The key person is responsible for the induction of the family and for settling the child into our setting.</li>
          <li>The key person offers unconditional regard for the child and is non-judgemental.</li>
          <li>The key person works with the parent to plan and deliver a personalised plan for the child's well-being, care and leaning.</li>
          <li>The key person acts as the key contact for the parents and has links with other carers involved with the child, such as a childminder, and co-ordinates the sharing of appropriate information about the child's development with those carers.</li>
          <li>The key person is responsible for developmental records and for sharing information on a regular basis with the child's parents to keep those records up-to-date, reflecting the full picture of the child in our setting and at home.</li>
          <li>The key person encourages positive relationships between children in her/his key group, spending time with them as a group each day.</li>
          <li>We provide a back up buddy key person for every child so the child and the parents have a key contact in the absence of the child's key person.</li>
          <li>We promote the role of the key person as the child's primary carer in our setting, and as the basis for establishing relationships with other staff and children.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Settling-in</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Before a child starts to attend the setting, we use a variety of ways to provide his/her parents with information. These include written information (including our prospectus and policies), displays about activities available within the setting, information days and evenings and individual meetings with parents.</li>
          <li>Before a child is enrolled, we provide opportunities for the child and his/her parents to visit the setting.</li>
          <li>We allocate a key person to each child and his/her family before she/he starts to attend; the key person welcomes and looks after the child and his/her parents at the child's first session and during the settling-in process.</li>
          <li>We will fill in our 'All about me' forms with the parent to find out about the child's starting point and link to development matters.</li>
          <li>We may offer a home visit by the person who will be the child's key person, to ensure all relevant information about the child can be made known.</li>
          <li>We use pre-start visits and the first session at which a child attends to explain and complete, with his/her parents, the child's registration records.</li>
          <li>When a child starts to attend, we explain the process of settling-in with his/her parents and jointly decide on the best way to help the child to settle into the setting.</li>
          <li>We have an expectation that the parent, carer or close relative, will stay for most of the session during the first week, gradually taking time away from their child, increasing this as and when the child is able to cope.</li>
          <li>Younger children will take longer to settle in, as will children who have not previously spent time away from home. Children who have had a period of absence may also need their parent to be on hand to re-settle them.</li>
          <li>We judge a child to be settled when they have formed a relationship with their key person; for example, the child looks for the key person when he/she arrives, goes to them for comfort and seems pleased to be with them. The child is also familiar with where things are and is pleased to see other children and participate in activities.</li>
          <li>When parents leave, we ask them to say goodbye to their child and explain that they will be coming back, and when.</li>
          <li>We recognise that some children will settle more readily than others but that some children who appear to settle rapidly are not ready to be left. We expect that the parent will honour the commitment to stay for at least the first week, or possibly longer, until their child can stay happily without them.</li>
          <li>We do not believe that leaving a child to cry will help them to settle any quicker. We believe that a child's distress will prevent them from learning and gaining the best from the setting.</li>
          <li>We reserve the right not to accept a child into the setting without a parent or carer if the child finds it distressing to be left. This is especially the case with very young children.</li>
          <li>Within the first four to six weeks of starting we discuss and work with the child's parents to begin to create their child's record of achievement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">The progress check at age two</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The key person carries out the progress check at age two in accordance with any local procedures that are in place and referring to the supporting guidance to the EYFS A Know How Guide: The EYFS progress check at age two and forms from our Local Authority.</li>
          <li>The progress checks will be done in partnership with the Parents/Carers.</li>
          <li>The progress check aims to review the child's development and ensures that parents have a clear picture of their child's development.</li>
          <li>Within the progress check, the key person will note areas where the child is progressing well and identify areas where progress is less than expected.</li>
          <li>The progress check will describe the actions that will be taken by the setting to address any developmental concerns (including working with other professionals where appropriate) as agreed with the parent(s).</li>
          <li>The key person will plan activities to meet the child's needs within the setting and will support parents to understand the child's needs in order to enhance their development at home.</li>

      <div class="policy-section">
        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>In the event that a child is not collected by an authorised adult by their expected collection time, we put into practice agreed procedures. The child will receive a high standard of care in order to cause as little distress as possible.</p>

        <p>We inform parents/carers of our procedures so that, if they are unavoidably delayed, they will be reassured that their children will be properly cared for.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <h3>Information Required from Parents</h3>
        <p>Parents are asked to provide the following specific information when their child starts attending [our/my] setting, which is recorded on our Registration Form:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Home address and telephone number - if the parents do not have a telephone, an alternative number must be given, perhaps a neighbour or close relative.</li>
          <li>Place of work, address and telephone number (if applicable).</li>
          <li>Mobile telephone number (if applicable).</li>

          <li>Information about any person who does not have legal access to the child.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Communication and Changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>On occasions when parents are aware that they will not be at home or in their usual place of work, they inform us in writing of how they can be contacted.</li>
          <li>On occasions when parents, or the persons normally authorised to collect the child, are not able to collect the child, they provide us with written details of the name, address and telephone number of the person who will be collecting their child. We agree with parents how to verify the identity of the person who is to collect their child.</li>
          <li>Parents are informed that if they are not able to collect the child as planned, they must inform us so that we can begin to take back-up measures. Our contact telephone number is (020 8558 0666/020 7555 0133/Leyton) (020 8510 1731 Hackney).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Uncollected Child Procedures</h3>
        <p>If a child is not collected at their expected collection time, we follow the procedures below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The child's file is checked for any information about changes to the normal collection routines.</li>
          <li>If no information is available, parents/carers are contacted at home or at work.</li>
          <li>If this is unsuccessful, the adults who are authorised by the parents to collect their child - and whose telephone numbers are recorded on the Registration Form - are contacted. We need 2 emergency contact details.</li>
          <li>All reasonable attempts are made to contact the parents or nominated carers.</li>
          <li>The child does not leave the premises with anyone other than those named on the Registration Form or in their file.</li>
          <li>If no-one collects the child within 30 minutes of their expected collection time and there is no named contact who can be contacted to collect the child, we apply the procedures for uncollected children.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Safeguarding Procedures</h3>
        <p>If we have any cause to believe the child has been abandoned we contact the local authority children's social care team:</p>
        <p>If the children's social care team is unavailable [or as our local authority advise] we will contact the local police]</p>
        <p><strong>999</strong> (name and phone number)</p>
        <p>Or the out of hours duty officer (where applicable): (name and phone number)</p>

        <ul style="margin-top: 20px;">
          <li>After an additional 15 minutes if the child has not been collected, we will contact the above statutory agencies again.</li>
          <li>The child stays at the setting in the care of two of our fully-vetted workers, one of whom will be our manager or deputy manager until the child is safely collected either by the parents or by a social care worker, or by another person specified by social care.</li>
          <li>Social care will aim to find the parent or relative. If they are unable to do so, the child will become looked after by the local authority.</li>
          <li>Under no circumstances will we go to look for the parent, nor leave the setting premises with the child.</li>
          <li>We ensure that the child is not anxious and we do not discuss our concerns in front of them.</li>
          <li>A full written report of the incident is recorded in the child's file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Additional Measures</h3>

        <h2>Policy statement</h2>

        <p>We are committed to ensuring that our service is fully inclusive in meeting the needs of all children.</p>

        <p>We recognise that children and their families come from a wide range of backgrounds with individual needs, beliefs and values. They may grow up in family structures that include one or two parents of the same or different sex. Children may have close links or live with extended families of grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins; while other children may be more removed from close kin, or may live with other relatives or foster carers. Some children come from families who experience social exclusion, severe hardship; discrimination and prejudice because of their ethnicity, disability and/or ability, the languages they speak, their religious or personal beliefs, their sexual orientation and marital status. Some individuals face discrimination linked to their gender and some women are discriminated against because of their pregnancy and maternity status. We understand that all these factors can affect the well-being of children within these families and may adversely impact on children's learning, attainment and life outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>We are committed to anti-discriminatory practice to promote equality of opportunity and valuing diversity for all children and families using our setting. We aim to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Promote equality and value diversity within [our/my] service and foster good relations with the local community;</li>
          <li>Actively include all families and value the positive contribution they make to our service;</li>
          <li>Promote a positive non-stereotyping environment that promotes dignity, respect and understanding of difference in all forms;</li>
          <li>Provide a secure and accessible environment in which every child feels safe and equally included;</li>
          <li>Improve our knowledge and understanding of issues relating to anti-discriminatory practice,</li>
          <li>Challenge and eliminate discriminatory actions on the basis of a protected characteristic as defined by the Equality Act (2010) namely:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
              <li>age;</li>
              <li>gender;</li>
              <li>gender reassignment;</li>
              <li>marital status;</li>
              <li>pregnancy and maternity;</li>
              <li>race;</li>
              <li>disability;</li>
              <li>sexual orientation; and</li>
              <li>religion or belief.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>where possible, take positive action to benefit groups or individuals with protected characteristics who are disadvantaged, have a disproportional representation within the service or need different things from the service.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="procedures-section">
        <h2>Procedures</h2>

        <h3>Admissions</h3>
        <p>Our setting is open and accessible to all members of the community.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We base our Admissions Policy on a fair system.</li>
          <li>We do not discriminate against a child or their family in our service provision, including preventing their entry to our setting based on a protected characteristic as defined by the Equality Act (2010).</li>
          <li>We advertise our service widely.</li>
          <li>We provide information in clear, concise language, whether in spoken or written form and provide information in other languages (wherever possible).</li>
          <li>We reflect the diversity of our community and wider society in our publicity and promotional materials.</li>
          <li>We provide information on [our/my] offer of provision for children with special educational needs and disabilities.</li>
          <li>We ensure that all parents are made aware of our Valuing Diversity and Promoting Inclusion and Equality Policy.</li>
          <li>We make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled children can participate successfully in the services and in the curriculum offered by the setting.</li>
          <li>We ensure, wherever possible, that we have a balanced intake of boys and girls in the setting.</li>
          <li>We take action against any discriminatory, prejudice, harassing or victimising behaviour by our staff, volunteers or parents whether by:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
              <li><strong>Direct discrimination</strong> – someone is treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic e.g. preventing families of a specific ethnic group from using the service;</li>
              <li><strong>indirect discrimination</strong> – someone is affected unfavourably by a general policy e.g. children must only speak English in the setting;</li>
              <li><strong>Discrimination arising from a disability</strong> – someone is treated less favourably because of something connected with their disability e.g. a child with a visual impairment is excluded from an activity;</li>
              <li><strong>Association</strong> – discriminating against someone who is associated with a person with a protected characteristic e.g. behaving unfavourably to someone who is married to a person from a different cultural background; or</li>
              <li><strong>Perception</strong> – discrimination on the basis that it is thought someone has a protected characteristic e.g. making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We will not tolerate behaviour from an adult who demonstrates dislike or prejudice towards individuals who are perceived to be from another country (xenophobia).</li>
          <li>Displaying of openly discriminatory xenophobic and possibly offensive or threatening materials, name-calling, or threatening behaviour is unacceptable on, or around, our premises and will be dealt with immediately and discreetly by asking the adult to stop using the unacceptable behaviour and inviting them to read and to act in accordance with the relevant policy statement and procedure. Failure to comply may lead to the adult being excluded from the premises.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Employment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We advertise posts and all applicants are judged against explicit and fair criteria.</li>
          <li>Applicants are welcome from all backgrounds and posts are open to all.</li>
          <li>We may use the exemption clauses in relevant legislation to enable the service to best meet the needs of the community.</li>
          <li>The applicant who best meets the criteria is offered the post, subject to references and suitability checks. This ensures fairness in the selection process.</li>
          <li>All our job descriptions include a commitment to promoting equality and recognising and respecting diversity as part of their specifications.</li>
          <li>We monitor our application process to ensure that it is fair and accessible.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>We ensure that our staff are confident and fully trained in administering relevant medicines and performing invasive care procedures on children when these are required.</li>
          <li>We review our practices to ensure that we are fully implementing our policy for Valuing Diversity and Promoting Equality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Curriculum</h3>
        <p>The curriculum offered in our setting encourages children to develop positive attitudes about themselves as well as about people who are different from themselves. It encourages the development of confidence and self-esteem, empathy, critical thinking and reflection.</p>

        <p><strong>We ensure that our practice is fully inclusive by:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating an environment of mutual respect and tolerance;</li>
          <li>Modelling desirable behaviour to children and helping children to understand that discriminatory behaviour and remarks are hurtful and unacceptable;</li>
          <li>positively reflecting the widest possible range of communities within resources;</li>
          <li>Avoiding use of stereotypes or derogatory images within our books or any other visual materials;</li>
          <li>Celebrating locally observed festivals and holy days;</li>
          <li>Ensuring that children learning English as an additional language have full access to the curriculum and are supported in their learning;</li>
          <li>Ensuring that disabled children with and without special educational needs are fully supported;</li>
          <li>Ensuring that children speaking languages other than English are supported in the maintenance and development of their home languages</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>We will ensure that Our environment is as accessible as possible for all visitors and service users. We do this by:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>undertaking an access audit to establish if the setting is accessible to all disabled children and adults. If access to the setting is found to treat disabled children or adults less favourably, then [we/I] make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the needs of disabled children and adults.</li>
          <li>fully differentiating the environment, resources and curriculum to accommodate a wide range of learning, physical and sensory needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Valuing diversity in families</h3>

          <li>We encourage children to contribute stories of their everyday life to the setting.</li>
          <li>We encourage mothers, fathers and other carers to take part in the life of the setting and to contribute fully.</li>

          <li>We take positive action to encourage disadvantaged and under-represented groups to use the setting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Food</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We work in partnership with parents to ensure that dietary requirements of children that arise from their medical, religious or cultural needs are met wherever possible.</li>
          <li>We help children to learn about a range of food, and of cultural approaches to mealtimes and eating, and to respect the differences among them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Meetings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Meetings are arranged to ensure that all families who wish to may be involved in the running of the setting.</li>
          <li>We positively encourage fathers to be involved in the setting, especially those fathers who do not live with the child.</li>
          <li>Information about meetings is communicated in a variety of ways - written, verbal and where resources allow in translation – to ensure that all mothers and fathers have information about, and access to, the meetings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Monitoring and reviewing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>So that our policies and procedures remain effective, we monitor and review them annually to ensure [our/my] strategies meet our overall aims to promote equality, inclusion and to value diversity.</li>
          <li>We provide a complaints procedure and a complaints summary record for parents to see.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Public Sector Equality Duty</h3>
